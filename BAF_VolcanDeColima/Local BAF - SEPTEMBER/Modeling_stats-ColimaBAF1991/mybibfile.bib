abstract = {High-fidelity computational simulation can be an invaluable tool in planning strategies for hazard risk mitigation. The accuracy and reliability of the predictions are crucial elements of these tools being successful. We present here a new simulation tool for dry granular avalanches using several new techniques for enhancing numerical solution accuracy. Highlights of our new methodology are the use of a depth-averaged model of the conservation laws and an adaptive grid Godunov solver to solve the resulting equations. The software is designed to run on distributed memory supercomputers and makes use of digital elevation data dynamically, i.e., refine the grid and input data to finer resolutions to better capture flow features as the flow evolves. Our simulations are validated using quantitative and qualitative comparisons to tabletop experiments and data from field observations. Our software is freely available and uses only publicly available libraries and hence can be used on a wide range of hardware and software platforms. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Geophysical mass flows--debris flows, avalanches, landslides--can contain O(10(6)-10(10)) m(3) or more of material, often a mixture of soil and rocks with a significant quantity of interstitial fluid. These flows can be tens of meters in depth and hundreds of meters in length. The range of scales and the rheology of this mixture presents significant modelling and computational challenges. This paper describes a depth-averaged 'thin layer' model of geophysical mass flows containing a mixture of solid material and fluid. The model is derived from a 'two-phase' or 'two-fluid' system of equations commonly used in engineering research. Phenomenological modelling and depth averaging combine to yield a tractable set of equations, a hyperbolic system that describes the motion of the two constituent phases. If the fluid inertia is small, a reduced model system that is easier to solve may be derived.},

abstract = {This paper presents several standard and new methods for characterizing$\backslash$nthe effect of input data uncertainty on model output for hazardous$\backslash$ngeophysical mass flows. Note that we do not attempt here to characterize$\backslash$nthe inherent randomness of such flow events. We focus here on the$\backslash$nproblem of characterizing uncertainty in model output due to lack$\backslash$nof knowledge of such input for a particular event. Methods applied$\backslash$ninclude classical Monte Carlo and Latin hypercube sampling and more$\backslash$nrecent stochastic collocation, polynomial chaos, spectral projection$\backslash$nand a newly developed extension thereof named polynomial chaos quadrature.$\backslash$nThe simple and robust samplings based Monte Carlo type methods are$\backslash$nusually computationally intractable for reasonable physical models,$\backslash$nwhile the more sophisticated and computationally efficient polynomial$\backslash$nchaos method often breaks down for complex models. The spectral projection$\backslash$nand polynomial chaos quadrature methods discussed here produce results$\backslash$nof quality comparable to the polynomial chaos type methods while$\backslash$npreserving the simplicity and robustness of the Monte Carlo-type$\backslash$nsampling based approaches at much lower cost. The computational efficiency,$\backslash$nhowever, degrades with increasing numbers of random variables. A$\backslash$nprocedure for converting the output uncertainty characterization$\backslash$ninto a map showing the probability of a hazard threshold being exceeded$\backslash$nis also presented. The uncertainty quantification procedures are$\backslash$napplied first in simple settings to illustrate the procedure and$\backslash$nthen subsequently applied to the 1991 block-and-ash flows at Colima$\backslash$nVolcano, Mexico.},

abstract = "On October 16, 1955, at 10:45 a.m. (local time), after three days of intense rain (140 mm) that was twice the monthly average precipitation, a devastating flood surge formed a volcaniclastic debris flow on the eastern slopes of Nevado de Colima Volcano. Nearly simultaneous flood surges formed in the Arroyo Seco, Los Platanos, and Dos Volcanes ravines that coalesced with the larger flow in the Atenquique ravine. At each confluence with a tributary, the flow was diluted. The texture and structure of the preserved 1955 deposits near high water marks indicate that the downstream flow was mainly in the lower range of debris flow concentration (60% sediment concentration by weight). Downstream the tributaries, the flood encountered a ∼0.06×106 m3 water reservoir that failed, significantly increasing the surge volume. Additional entrained sediment also increased the flow volume. Downstream, the flood wave reached the town of Atenquique as an 8–9 m catastrophic wave causing the death of more than 23 people, the partial destruction of the town, and losses of ∼13,000,000 pesos (∼1 million US dollars today) to a paper mill and company facilities. According to eyewitness accounts the flood wave had a peak discharge that lasted ca. 10 to 15 minutes at Atenquique. Deposits at the site and the high-water marks observed from photographs of the town's church indicate that sediment concentration was ca. 60 wt.%. The flood continued for about 1 km to its junction with the Tuxpan River where it was diluted by mixing with normal flood flow. The deposits covered an area of ∼1.2 km2 and had a minimum volume of ∼3.2×106 m3. The main deposit consists of a single unit, averaging 4 m in thickness, with weak textural variations that suggest surging within the flood wave. The deposit is heterolithologic and consists of boulders set in a matrix of sand-size sediment, with polymodal or bimodal distributions and normal grading varying with distance from source. The town of Atenquique has been reconstructed largely within the area inundated by the 1955 flood wave, thus creating the conditions for a future disaster. A rainfall-intensity warning system and an educational program for inhabitants are strategies to mitigate this risk."

The eruption started in 17 January and peaked in 20 January, 1913. It occurred in three main phases: 1) An opening phase with the generation of Merapi-type pyroclastic flows (units F1, F2, F3) and a pyroclastic surge (S1), 2) A vent-clearing phase with strong explosions that produced Vulcanian-Soufriere-type pyroclastic flows (F4) and a pyroclastic surge (S2) which destroyed the summit dome decompressing the magma system, and 3) a Plinian phase with the establishment of a ∼ 23 km high column dispersing a fallout (C1) to the \{NE\} followed by the collapse of the column that generated a pyroclastic surge (S3) and 15-km long pumice-rich pyroclastic flows (F5). After the eruption, remobilization of the pyroclastic material generated lahars in main gullies around the crater. Fallout \{C1\} blanketed an area of ∼ 191,318 km2 covering the cities of Guzman, Guadalajara, and Saltillo (Coahuila) located at 725 km from the source. It had a volume of 1.4 km3 (0.57 km3 \{DRE\} = Dense Rock Equivalent). The total volume of pyroclastic flow and surge deposits was 0.26 km3 (0.07 km3 DRE) giving a total volume of the eruption of 1.66 km3 (0.64 km3 DRE). The Plinian column lasted 4.6 h with a total mass of 1.5 × 1012 kg and a mass eruption rate of 9.02 × 107 kg/s. The column height and the ejected magma volume indicate that the 1913 eruption had a \{VEI\} = 5 being the largest event in the historical record of Colima Volcano. Juvenile scoria and pumice consisted of Pl &gt; Opx &gt; Cpx &gt; Hbl + accessory titanomagnetite + Ap and Ol with reaction rims. Chemistry of juvenile scoria and pumice samples is andesitic very homogeneous (58.3 ± 0.5 wt.% SiO2) and similar to the 1818 juvenile products (58.9 ± 0.2 wt.% SiO2). The presence of banded scoria, olivine phenocrysts with reaction rims, and trace element variations strongly suggest that the 1913 eruption was caused by a magma mixing event. "

abstract={A Bayesian uncertainty quantification approach is developed and applied to RANS turbulence models of fully-developed channel flow. The approach aims to capture uncertainty due to both uncertain parameters and model inadequacy. Parameter uncertainty is represented by treating the parameters of the turbulence model as random variables. To capture model uncertainty, four stochastic extensions of four eddy viscosity turbulence models are developed. The sixteen coupled models are calibrated using DNS data according to Bayes' theorem, producing posterior probability density functions. In addition, the competing models are compared in terms of two items: posterior plausibility and predictions of a quantity of interest. The posterior plausibility indicates which model is preferred by the data according to Bayes' theorem, while the predictions allow assessment of how strongly the model differences impact the quantity of interest. Results for the channel flow case show that both the stochastic model and the turbulence model affect the predicted quantity of interest. The posterior plausibility favors an inhomogeneous stochastic model coupled with the Chien k- ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/epsilon.gif] {epsilon} model. After calibration with data at Re τ = 944 and Re τ = 2003, this model gives a prediction of the centerline velocity at Re τ = 5000 with uncertainty of approximately ± 4%.}

abstract="Volc{\'a}n de Colima is one of the most active volcanoes in Mexico. Several hazard maps have been published based on reconstruction of the Late Pleistocene--Holocene eruptive history and historical records for the last 400 years. Recent detailed published studies have improved the knowledge of the eruptive history of the volcano and proposed a new hazard zonation based on numerical simulation for debris avalanche, pyroclastic density currents (PDCs), debris flows and fallout events. The new hazard map incorporates all these new data and proposes a revised hazard zonation useful for improving decision-making both previously and during crises. A sub-Plinian to Plinian multi-stage eruption similar to the ad 1913 event would represent a major hazard for populated areas around Volc{\'a}n de Colima. PDCs initiated by column collapses could travel up to 15 km from the eruptive vent. Tephra dispersal modeling shows that up to 10 cm of fallout deposits could affect several cities (population more than{\textasciitilde}180,000 people). Lahars (including the wide spectra of volcaniclastic flows), the most common hazard during the rainy season, would affect the main ravines up to a distance of 15 km from the Volc{\'a}n de Colima cone, impacting infrastructures and small villages. A Plinian eruption scenario also includes the possible generation of large volume lahars (up to 5 {\texttimes} 106 m3), possibly reaching major villages (i.e., San Marcos, Queser{\'i}a, Tonila) with catastrophic effects. Block-and-ash PDCs from summit dome collapse will travel in the main ravines up to distances between 4 and 7 km, with slightly longer runout for associated turbulent PDCs. Despite a recurrence rate probably >2,000 years, partial edifice collapse constitutes the major hazard. Large volume (>5 km3) debris avalanches can disrupt the southern slopes of the volcano up to a distance of 30 km affecting the Colima city, potentially associated with laterally directed blasts and secondary debris flows that in the past reached the Pacific coast.",
