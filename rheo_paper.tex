\abstract
Dense large scale granular avalanches are a complex class of flows with physics that has often been poorly captured by models that are computationally tractable. Sparsity of actual flow data (usually only a posteriori  deposit information is available) and large uncertainty in the mechanisms of initiation and flow propagation make the modeling task challenging and a subject of much continuing interest. Models that appear to represent the physics well in certain flows turn out to be poorly behaved in others due to intrinsic mathematical or numerical issues. Nevertheless, given the large implications on life and property many models with different modeling assumptions have been proposed.

While, inverse problems can shed some light on parameter choices it is difficult to make firm judgements on the validity or appropriateness of any single or set of modeling assumptions for a particular target flow or potential flows that needs to be modeled for predictive use in hazard analysis. We will present here an uncertainty quantification  based approach to carefully, analyze the effect of modeling assumptions on quantities of interest in simulations based on three established models (Mohr-Coulomb, Pouliquen-Forterre and Voellmy-Salm) and thereby derive a model (from a set of modeling assumptions) suitable for use in a particular context. We also illustrate that a simpler though more restrictive approach is to use a Bayesian modeling average approach based on the limited data to combine the outcomes of different models.

We juxtapose observation data to the simulation results, only with the purpose to maintain a link to the real occurrence of a geophysical flow representing a possible outcome of the case studies described. The fundamental focus of this paper is the exploration of the dynamics of the simulated flows, enabling a notion of the contribution of different mechanisms or models elements inside the simulation procedure, in a fully quantitative, predictive-use oriented and statistical framework.

\section{Introduction - Andrea}\label{sec:Intro}

\subsection{Geophysical mass Flows - Andrea}\label{subsec:FlowTypes}
Geophysical mass flows include debris and mud flows, landslides, snow and rock avalanches, glacier flows, pyroclastic surges, block and ash flows, and pumice flows, lahars, jokulhaups and many other examples. These flows are sometimes tens of kilometers in length and may travel at speeds as fast as hundreds of meters per second. Their deposits can be as much as tens of meters deep and kilometers long. In other words, there is no single universal description of a ``typical'' geophysical mass flow. Different types of flows are the results of different types of mechanisms/processes and hence different types of flows will have significantly different physical characteristics.

The rheology complexity of the fluidized material, the mathematical problem of modeling and computing, make the description of the dynamics of those flows really challenging. In many cases the flows are \emph{shallow}, i.e. the horizontal dimension is significantly larger than the flow depth. This assumption allows a depth-integration of the governing 3D Navier-Stokes-type equations, leading to the formulation of the 2D Shallow Water Equations (SWE), also called Saint Venant Equations \citep{Batchelor2000, Luca2016}. A large number of studies were focused on the modeling of depth-averaged geophysical flows, many of them reviewed in \cite{PudasainiHutter2007}. In \cite{SavageHutter1989,Jaeger1989, Hutter1993, FraccarolloToro1995, DadeHuppert1998} a depth-averaged model for granular material was first developed, and applied to the case study of an inclined plane, following the Mohr-Coulomb rheology (MC).

The modeling of a granular flow down an inclined plane was explored in detail by several further studies, both theoretical and experimental \citep{Pouliquen1999, RuyerQuil2000, Silbert2001, Balmforth2005, Bursik2005, DaCruz2005, Lajeunesse2005}. Terrain erosion effects were explored \citep{Pitman2003b, Edwards2015}, and also material deposition and self-channelling effects \citep{Mangeney2005, Mangeney2007}. The inclined plane experiments also led to the development of the Pouliquen-Forterre rheology (PF), assuming a changing frictional behavior as a function of flow regime, allowing for an improved wave-propagation and vortices-evolution in the flow \citep{Pouliquen1999, ForterrePouliquen2002, PouliquenForterre2002, ForterrePouliquen2003, Forterre2006, Jop2006}.

In parallel to the earth avalanches experiments, the study of snow avalanches led to the development of the Voellmy rheology (VS) \citep{Voellmy1955, Bartelt1999, Salm1990, Salm1993, BarteltMcArdell2009}.  Such rheology assumes a velocity dependent \emph{turbulent} friction term in addition to the Coulomb friction. Many experimental and theoretical studies were developed in this framework \citep{Gruber2007, Kern2009, Christen2010, Fischer2012}. 

In \cite{Iverson1997, Iverson2001, Denlinger2001, Denlinger2004, Iverson2004} the depth-averaged model was further studied and applied on a realistic terrain. \cite{Wieland1999, Gray1999, Gray2003} tested the model on fast avalanches, exploring the effects of channelizing/chuting topographies. A compensation for the effect of earth pressure changes was implemented and explored in detail \citep{Pirulli2007,Pirulli2008}, as well as the effects of significant curvature in the terrain \citep{Greve1994, PudasainiHutter2003, Fischer2012}. Several specific studies on the pore pressure effects on the flow initiation and fluidization were developed \citep{SavageIverson2003, Iordanoff2004, Iverson2014}. A two-phase model was also implemented to replicate heterogenous flows, with a significant quantity of interstitial fluid \citep{PitmanLe2005} All these complex modeling choices correspond to alternative or cumulative physical assumptions, and they are sometimes very difficult to ponder, compare or combine together.

A particular interest is associated with the specific efforts devoted to the modeling of volcanic mass flows with SWE \citep{FreundtBursik1998,Bursik2005,Saucedo2005, Kelfoun2005,Charbonnier2009,Kelfoun2009,Procter2010,Sulpizio2010,Kelfoun2011,Charbonnier2013}. Volcanoes are a great source of a rich variety of geophysical flows examples, as well as field data.

In this study we will take advantage of the TITAN2D code solving the shallow-water equations, and implementing the MC, PF and VS rheologies in the same platform \citep{Pitman2003a, Patra2005, Patra2006, Yu2009, Aghakhani2016}. The TITAN2D code already achieved many successful applications in the simulation of different geophysical mass flows, with specific peculiarities \citep{Sheridan2005, Rupp2006, Norini2008, Charbonnier2009, Procter2010, Sheridan2010, Sulpizio2010, Capra2011}. Several studies involving TITAN2D were recently directed towards a statistical study of geophysical flows, focusing on the uncertainty quantification and propagation \citep{Dalbey2008, Dalbey2009, Stefanescu2012a, Stefanescu2012b}, or on the more efficient production of hazard maps \citep{Bayarri2009, Spiller2014,Bayarri2015, Ogburn2016}. This study for the first time applies a statistical approach to the detailed exploration of the stresses and powers in the flow, as well as on the velocity and height and inundated area. The former have a strong link with the dynamical equation terms, the latter have a direct link to field observation and hazard assessments. Our purpose is the achievement of a quantitative and statistical understanding of the different physical assumptions, both inside the flow and on the outputs.

\subsection{Overview of the case studies - Andrea}
The first case study assumes very simple boundary conditions, and correspond to an experiment fully described in \cite{Webb2004, Bursik2005, WebbBursik2016}. It is a classical flow down an inclined plane experiment, including a change in slope to an horizontal plane (Fig. \ref{fig:Ramp-first}).

\begin{figure}[H]

    \centering
    \caption{Inclined plane description, including local samples sites (red stars).}
    \label{fig:Ramp-first}
\end{figure}

A second case study is a block and ash flow down the slope of Volc{\'a}n de Colima (M{\'e}xico) - an andesitic stratovolcano that rises to 3,860 m above sea level, situated in the western portion of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (Fig. 2). Historically, it has been the most active volcano in M{\'e}xico \citep{DeLaCruzReina1993, Zobin2002, Gonzalez2002}. During July 10$^{th}$–11$^{th}$ 2015, the volcano underwent its most intense eruptive phase since its Subplinian–Plinian 1913 AD eruption \citep{Saucedo2010, Zobin2015, ReyesDaVilla2016, Capra2016}. The modeling of pyroclastic flows generated by explosive eruptions and lava dome collapses of Volc{\'a}n de Colima is a well studied problem \citep{DelPozzo1995,Sheridan1995,Saucedo2002,Saucedo2004,Saucedo2005, Sarocchi2011, Capra2015}. The volcano has been already used as a case study in several research involving the Titan2D code \citep{Rupp2004, Rupp2006, Dalbey2008, Yu2009, Sulpizio2010, Capra2011, Aghakhani2016}.

In this study the flow is assumed to be generated by the gravitational collapse of a paraboloid dome placed close to the summit area. A dome collapse occurs when there is a significant amount of recently-extruded highly-viscous lava piled up in an unstable configuration around a vent. Further extrusion and/or externals forces can cause the still hot dome of viscous lava to collapse, disintegrate, and avalanche downhill \citep{Bursik2005}. The hot, dense blocks in this ``block and ash'' flow will typically range from centimeters to a few meters in size. The matrix is composed of fine ash from the comminuted blocks. Computations were performed on a DEM with 5m-pixel resolution, obtained from LiDAR data acquired in 2005 \citep{Davila2007, Sulpizio2010}.

\section{Review of Models -- Ali + Andrea}\label{sec:GeoPhFlows}

\subsection{Modeling Assumptions - Ali + Andrea}\label{subsec:ModelAssump}
 Any numerical model of geophysical mass flows relies on several physical and mathematical assumptions. We will classify them in two groups - the general assumptions and the rheology assumptions. The main focus of this study is on the latter group, but in future the same procedure could be applied to the former.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The moving mass was assumed to be \textit{volume preserving}. Since the dynamics define the motion, assuming volume preserving is an adequate approximation.
\item Geophysical mass flows are mostly assumed to be \textit{free surface} flows consist of granular material (i.e. a large collection of discrete particles, frequently with interstitial fluid, and whatever else that get caught in the flow path). In general, the ``typical particle'' is small compared to the depth and length of the flowing mass and makes it reasonable to model the flowing material as a continuum which implies that the thickness of sliding and deforming body extends over several particle diameters. Therefore, we can consider an ``equivalent flowing material'' whose rheological properties are chosen to approximate the bulk behavior that is expected of an actual mass flow; however, the properties of this ``equivalent material'' may not correspond to those of any component of the actual mass flow.
\item According to the \textit{geometries} of geophysical mass flows, numerous models make the \textit{shallowness} approximation for their numerical simulation. In this approximation, the flow depth is assumed to be at least an order of magnitude less than the characteristic length of the flowing material.
\item The shear stresses lateral to the main flow direction can be neglected.
\item The body of mass is supposed to be in \textit{isothermal} state or, if not, thermal effects can be ignored.
\item The flowing mass is assumed to be consisted of an \textit{incompressible} granular continuum material. This means that we are allowed to ignore variations of density due to the void ratio (density preserving assumption).
\item Motion of the bulk of mass consists of ``shearing within the deforming mass'' and ``sliding along the basal surface''. However, based on the observations, the shearing deformation commonly takes place within a very small boundary layer, so that it is justified to collapse this boundary layer to zero thickness and to combine the sliding and shearing velocity to a single sliding law with a somewhat larger modelled \textit{sliding velocity}. This then effectively means that variations of the material velocities across the flow depth may be ignored and \textit{depth-averaged} equations may be employed \citep{SavageHutter1989,Hutter1993}. Details on the integration of continuum models for shallow free surface flows can be studied in \citep{PudasainiHutter2007}.%This method was introduced by Von K\'{a}rm\'{a}n and later refined by Pohlhausen, where the equations are averaged over depth and the velocity profile is assumed.
\item The shallowness assumption gives a \textit{hydrostatic} expression for the normal pressure in the direction perpendicular to the basal surface. Moreover, the downslope and cross-slope pressure components are assumed to be varying linearly with the normal pressure component through the flow depth. The coefficient could either be defined based on the rheology model or be constant \citep{SavageHutter1989,Bartelt1999,Iverson2001,Denlinger2001}.
\end{enumerate}
%This list is not comprehensive across the many models that have been proposed for such flows.
\subsection{Governing Equations and Boundary Conditions - Ali}\label{subsec:GovEqsBCs}
Starting with the basic conservation of mass and momentum for an incompressible medium, we can describe the motion of an avalanching mass:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:N_S}
\nabla \cdot\underline{{\textbf u}} &=& 0, \nonumber \\
\dfrac{\partial}{\dt}(\rho \ \underline{{\textbf u}})+\nabla \cdot (\rho \ \underline{{\textbf u}}\otimes \underline{{\textbf u}}) &=& \nabla \cdot \underline{\underline{{\mathbf{T}}}}+\rho \ \underline{{\textbf g}},
\end{eqnarray}
Where $\underline{{\textbf u}}=[u, v, w]^{\mathrm{T}}$, is the material velocity vector, $\rho$ is its constant density, $\underline{\underline{{\mathbf{T}}}}$ is the \textit{Cauchy} stress tensor, and $\underline{{\textbf g}}$ is the gravity vector. Based on the material rheology we choose, the Cauchy stress tensor, $\underline{\underline{{\mathbf{T}}}}$, is defined differently \citep{FreundtBursik1998}. Defining the free and basal surface interfaces respectively as follows,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:surfacesDefs}
F^s(x,y,t) &=& s(x,y,t)-z, \nonumber \\
F^b(x,y,t) &=& b(x,y,t)-z,
\end{eqnarray}
Therefore, one can impose the \textit{kinematic boundary conditions} at free and basal surface interfaces:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:SurKinBC}
\frac{\partial F^s}{\dt} + \underline{{\textbf u}}\cdot\nabla F^s = 0, \ \ at \ F^s(x,y,t)=0
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:BedKinBC}
\frac{\partial F^b}{\dt} + \underline{{\textbf u}}\cdot\nabla F^b = 0, \ \ at \ F^b(x,y,t)=0
\end{equation}
According to the $\mathrm{2^{nd}}$ and $\mathrm{7^{th}}$ assumptions, we may also impose the traction-free boundary condition at the free surface, while a \textit{Coulomb dry-friction} sliding law at the interface between the granular flow and the basal surface is imposed:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:SurTracBC}
\underline{\underline{{\mathbf{T}}}}^s\underline{n}^s=\underline{0}, \ \ at \ F^s(x,y,t)=0
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:BedTracBC}
\underline{\underline{{\mathbf{T}}}}^b\underline{n}^b-\underline{n}^b(\underline{n}^b\cdot \underline{\underline{{\mathbf{T}}}}^b\underline{n}^b)=\frac{\underline{{\textbf u}}^b}{\Vert\underline{{\textbf u}}^b\Vert}(\underline{n}^b\cdot \underline{\underline{{\mathbf{T}}}}^b\underline{n}^b)\mu_{\mathrm{Bed}}, \ \ at \ F^b(x,y,t)=0
\end{equation}
where $\mu_{\mathrm{Bed}}$ is the basal friction coefficient and the basal and surface unit normals are:
\begin{equation}
\underline{n}^b=\frac{\nabla F^b}{\Vert\nabla F^b\Vert}, \ \ \underline{n}^s=\frac{\nabla F^s}{\Vert\nabla F^s\Vert}.
\end{equation}
It is worth mentioning that $\underline{\underline{{\mathbf{T}}}} \ \underline{n}$ is a resisting traction, while $\underline{n}\cdot\underline{\underline{{\mathbf{T}}}} \ \underline{n}$ is the normal pressure and $\underline{n}\cdot\underline{\underline{{\mathbf{T}}}}-\underline{n}(\underline{n}\cdot\underline{\underline{{\mathbf{T}}}} \ \underline{n})$ is the resulting shear traction. Considering Equation (\ref{eq:BedTracBC}), Coulomb dry-friction sliding law expresses that the magnitude of the basal shear stress is equal to the normal basal pressure multiplied by the basal friction coefficient, $\mu_{\mathrm{Bed}}$. Furthermore, Equation (\ref{eq:BedTracBC}) is stating that the shear traction is assumed to point in the opposite direction to the basal velocity, $\underline{{\textbf u}}^b$ (resisting shear traction) which also implicitly assumes that $\underline{{\textbf u}}^b\cdot \underline{n}^b=0$ when we also consider the basal kinematic boundary condition.

\subsection{Models}\label{subsec:Models}

\section{UQ Process - Andrea}
The key purpose of this study is to present a procedure for the improved exploration and quantitative comparison of physical models and their assumptions through the collection of full statistical data. Models are not black boxes, behind each physical model there are different physical assumptions, and therefore it would be more appropriate to look at those instead than at the entire model results. Our statistical approach enables a first step towards a data driven selection of the best modeling assumptions to use.

In particular, a good forecasting capability in the context of mass flows requires the careful selection of the pair $(M(A), P(M(A)))$, where $A$ is a set of assumptions, $M(A)$ is the model which combines those assumptions, and $P(M)$ is a probability distribution in the parameter space of $M$. An assumption is a quite general concept - for example it can be a specific equation for the internal stress, the implementation of bed curvature effects, of active-passive material stretching, or the use of a specific correction on the pressure effects, etc... Assumptions are what makes the models being different, and each model may be seen as the combined result of a set of assumptions. Sometimes a good model contains a useless assumption that may be removed, sometimes a good assumption should be implemented inside a different model - those are usually considered as subjective choices, not data driven. Moreover, the correct assumptions may change through time, making the analysis more difficult.

It is worth mentioning that whereas the support of $P(M)$ can be restricted to a single point in case an optimization procedure is performed for the reconstruction of a particular flow, this is not possible if we are interested in the general predictive capabilities of the model, i.e. what is desired in probabilistic hazard assessment. In this study we will always assume $P(M)\sim \bigotimes_{i=1}^{N_M} Unif(a_{i,M},b_{i,M})$, where $N_M$ is the number of parameters of $M$. These parameter ranges will not be selected under the influence of a particular observation, but we will try to use the information gathered in literature about the physical meaning of those values.

In general, the simulation algorithms can be classified as:
$$\textmd{(1)INPUT VARIABLES} \longrightarrow \textmd{(2)DYNAMICAL QUANTITIES} \longrightarrow \textmd{(3)OBSERVABLE OUTPUTS}$$

The input variables can include: volume, rheology coefficients, initiation site and geometry, digital elevation map. We will focus on the former two of those, the volume of the pile and the rheology, which constitute our parameter space in all the case studies. The dynamical quantities are directly related to the force terms in the Newton Equations that rule the simulation, they include: driving and dissipative stresses and powers. The terms of the equations are hidden to the observation, but they directly depend on the parameters, and represent a fundamental link between the parameters and the observable outputs. Moreover, the models share some of those terms while change others, and this enables a detailed comparison of the real physics below the curtain. Finally, the observable outputs include: flow height, inundated area, flow velocity and acceleration. In the sequel (2) and (3) are also called quantities of interest (QoI).

Another level of complexity can be achieved choosing the degree of integration of (2) and (3) in the previous scheme:
\begin{description}
  \item[(A)] LOCAL MEASUREMENTS
  \item[(B)] SPATIAL AVERAGES
  \item[(C)] TEMPORAL AVERAGES
  \item[(D)] SPATIO-TEMPORAL (FULL) AVERAGES
\end{description}

In particular, all the dynamical quantities, and most of the observable outputs, have a local meaning. They are calculated on the elements of the numerical mesh created by the code. Moreover, all those quantities are time dependent. Differences in time and location enable to constrain the changes in flow regime. Those are really important because if the flow behavior is radically different, then the significance and effects of the assumptions may also change.

A first approach to look at the data is to choose a reasonable design of spatial locations and to calculate the graph of the quantities as a function of time. A second approach is to make the spatial integral of those quantities and calculate their temporal graph - this integration can be done with respect to the basal area, e.g. for the stresses and related powers, or with respect to the flow volume, e.g. velocity and acceleration. A third possible approach requires to make the integrals through time at each designed spatial site, a fourth approach the full integral in space-time.

In general, for each QoI and degree of integration, during a Monte Carlo simulation we sample the input variables and obtain a family of temporal graphs in (A), (B), and numeric values in (C), (D). These results are statistically summarized - plotting their expectation, their standard deviation, their 5th and 95 percentiles. Their correlation structure is also explored, presenting the plots of the Pearson coefficients of the most interesting pairs of quantities in (1), (2), (3). In the following, we will detail the considered input variables and quantities of interest for each of our cases study.

Our sampling technique of the input variables is based on the Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) idea, and in particular, on the improved space-filling properties of the orthogonal array-based Latin Hypercubes (see Appendix A). The LHS is performed over $[0,1]^3$ for the MC and VS input parameters, and $[0,1]^4$ for PF input parameters. Those samples are homothetically transformed to fill the required intervals.

\subsection{Definition and consistency of the Input parameters - Andrea + Ali}
In general, the three rheologies considered in this study, MC, PF, and VS, have different parameters, but in all them it is defined a basal friction stress $F$. That is $F=\tan(\phi_{bed})$ in MC, $F=\tan(\phi_2)$ for $Fr\gg h$ in PF, $F=\mu$ in VS. We use those relations to define parameter spaces which produce reasonably consistent ranges of basal frictions. In the following sections, we start defining a range for $\phi_{bed}$ of MC, specific of the scenario and obtained from the more rich literature of that rheology, then we impose a consistent range for the related parameters of PF and VS, and leave the other parameters unchanged. In particular:

\vskip.3cm\noindent \textbf{MC}
\par\noindent $\phi_{bed} \in [a, b]$, depending on the case study.
\par\noindent $\phi_{int}-\phi_{bed}=\Delta \phi \in [2, 10]$, following \cite{Dalbey2008}, but 25\% enlargement on the higher side of the uncertainty range.

\vskip.3cm\noindent \textbf{PF}
\par\noindent $\phi_2 = \phi_{bed}$, but with $\sim$20\% enlargement on the higher side of the uncertainty range.
\par\noindent $\phi_2-\phi_1=\Delta \phi_{12} \in [5, 15]$ (\cite{Gray2014} used 9 degrees, \cite{Barker2015} 11 degrees).
\par\noindent $\beta \in [0.1, 0.85]$  (\cite{Gray2014} assumed $\beta=0.14$, \cite{ForterrePouliquen2003} $\beta=0.65$)
\par\noindent $L=10^{-3}$, $\phi_3=35$ \citep{Gray2014} due to their reduced sensitivity (see Appendix B).

\vskip.3cm\noindent \textbf{VS}
\par\noindent $\mu = \tan(\phi_{bed})$, with $\sim$20\% enlargement of the uncertainty range.
\par\noindent $\log(\xi) \in [1.7, 4] = \log[50, 10^4]$, i.e. in this case the uniform sampling is accomplished in log-scale.

\section{QoIs and Data Collected}
\subsection{Flow down an inclined plane, and a change in slope to a flat plane - Andrea+Ali}
The parameter ranges adopted in this case study are:

\vskip.3cm\noindent \textbf{MC} - $\phi_{bed} \in [15, 30]$ \citep{Dalbey2008}, $\quad \Delta\phi \in [2, 10]$.

\vskip.3cm\noindent \textbf{PF} - $\phi_2 \in [15, 35]$, $\quad\Delta\phi_{12} \in [5, 15]$, $\quad\beta \in [0.1, 0.85]$, $\quad L=10^{-3}$, $\quad \phi_3=\phi_1 + 1$.

\vskip.3cm\noindent \textbf{VS} - $\mu \in [0.2, 0.7]$, $\quad \log(\xi) \in [1.7, 4]$.

\subsubsection{Force contributions - Andrea+Ali}
A statistical analysis capable of measuring the contributions of different force components in the rheology models is a fundamental task. This is also necessary to explore and compare the effects of the assumptions behind some modeling choices, onto the time evolution of the flowing material. Let $(F_i(x,t))_{i=1,\dots, n}$ be the array of force components, where $x\in\mathbb R^2$ is a spatial location, and $t\in T$ is a time instant. In our case study, $F_1$ is the gravitational force, $F_2$ is the basal friction, $F_3$ is the curvature correction, $F_4$ is a resistive force (or the hydrostatic pressure term, in the case of Pouliquen-Forterre rheology). However, this type of procedure can be applied to any additive decomposition of the physical forces. In addition, we can include in the analysis also the component of the inertial forces, i.e. $F_4$ the convective force and $F_5$ the transient force. The analysis of local effects can be compared to the contribution of global dynamics.

In this case we are projecting the forces on the directions X and Y, i.e. respectively in the slope direction, and orthogonal to the slope direction on an horizontal plane. Hence in the following the forces are scalar and not vectorial terms. It is important to remark that all the forces are depending on the sample $\eta$ on the parameter domains, and hence are considered as random variables.

The degree of contribution of those force terms is significantly variable in space and time. For this reason, the following analysis is performed on locally sampled measurements, and not in a spatial averaging framework. In particular, four locations are selected among the center line of the flow. These are: the initial pile location $x_1=-0.7$ m, the middle of the inclined plane $x_2=-0.35$ m, the change in slope $x_3=0$ m, the middle of the flat plane $x_4=0.15$ m. Next notation will assume to be in a selected location $x=x_k$, where $k\in\{1,\dots, 4\}$. The definitions are not depending on the location, but all the results will significantly depend of that choice.

\begin{definition}[Contribution coefficients]
Let $(F_i)_{i=1,\dots, n}$ be random variables on $(\Omega, \mathcal F, P)$, representing the considered force components in location $x$ at time $t$. Then, for each component $i$, the contribution coefficient is defined as:
$$C_i:=\mathbb E\left[\frac{F_i}{\Phi}\right],$$
where $\Phi$ is a dominating function, i.e. $\Phi\ge |F_i|$, $\forall i$.
\end{definition}
The \emph{total force}, i.e $\sum_i F_i$ excluding the inertial terms, is not a good candidate for a dominating function. Indeed, the terms often have opposite signs, and their sum can be really small. Another issue is given by the existence of a subset of times $\Theta$ characterized by the absence of flow in the selected location $x$. In $\Theta$ the dominant force is null, and cannot be the denominator of a fraction.

We explore two alternative $\Phi$ choices: $\Phi_1$ is based on the $l^1$ norm, and defined as:
$$\Phi_1:=\left\{
    \begin{array}{ll}
      \sum_i \frac{|F_i|}{2}, & \hbox{if not null;} \\
      1, & \hbox{otherwise.}
    \end{array}
  \right.$$
In case we exclude the inertial forces from the analysis, we must take $\hat{\Phi_1}=2\Phi_1$. In contrast $\Phi_2$ is the dominant force, based on the $l^\infty$ norm:
$$\Phi_2:=\left\{
    \begin{array}{ll}
      \max_i |F_i|, & \hbox{if not null;} \\
      1, & \hbox{otherwise.}
    \end{array}
  \right.$$
In particular, for a particular location $x$, time $t$, and parameter sample $\eta$, we have $C_i=0$ if there is no flow or all the forces are null. The expectation of $C_i$ is reduced by the chance of $F_i$ being small compared to the other terms, or by the chance of having no flow in $(x,t)$. Moreover, $\mathbb E[C_i]\in[-1,1]$, $\forall i$.
\begin{proposition}
Let $\Phi_k$, $k=1,2$ be the functions described above. Then they are well defined dominating function, i.e. $\Phi_k\ge |F_j|$, $\forall j,k$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
If $k=1$, the Newton equation states $\sum_{j\in J} F_j =\sum_{i\in I} F_i,$ where $(F_j)_{j\in J}$ are inertial forces, and $(F_i)_{i\in I}$ the local forces. Then, $\forall h\in I$
$$F_h=\sum_{i\neq h,\ i\in I} F_i - \sum_{j\in J} F_j.$$
And hence
$$|F_h|\le |F_h|+\sum_{i\neq k,\ i\in I} |F_i| - \sum_{j\in J} |F_j|=2\Phi_1.$$
A similar equation is valid $\forall k\in J$. If $k=2$, or if the inertial forces are not included, the proof is trivial.
\end{proof}

Furthermore, assuming $\Phi=\Phi_2$, there is a useful result explaining the meaning of those coefficients through the conditional expectation.
\begin{proposition}
Let $(F_i)_{i=1,\dots, n}$ be random variables on $(\Omega, \mathcal F, P)$, representing the considered force components in location $x$ at time $t$. For each $i$, let $C_i$ be the contribution coefficient of force $F_i$, assuming $\Phi=\Phi_2$. Then we have the following expression:
$$C_i=\sum_j p_j \mathbb E\left[\frac{F_i}{|F_j|}\ \Big{|}\ \Phi=|F_j|\right],$$
where $p_j:=P\left\{\Phi=|F_j|\right\}$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Let $Z$ be a discrete random variable such that, for each $j\in\mathbb N$, $(Z=j) \Longleftrightarrow (\Phi=|F_j|)$. Then, by the rule of chain expectation:
$$C_i=\mathbb E\left[\frac{F_i}{\Phi}\right]=\mathbb E\left[\mathbb E\left[\frac{F_i}{\Phi}\ \Big{|}\ Z=j\right]\right]=$$
$$=\mathbb E\left[\mathbb E\left[\frac{F_i}{|F_j|}\ \Big{|}\ Z=j\right]\right]=\sum_j P\left\{Z=j\right\} \mathbb E\left[\frac{F_i}{|F_j|}\ \Big{|}\ Z=j\right].$$
Moreover, by definition, $p_j=P\left\{Z=j\right\}$. This completes the proof.
\end{proof}

The last proposition brings to the definition of the dominance factors $(p_j)_{j=1,\dots, k}$, i.e. the probability of each $F_j$ to be the dominant force in $(x,t)$.

\begin{definition}[Dominance factors and conditional contributions]
Let $(F_i)_{i=1,\dots, k}$ be random variables on $(\Omega, \mathcal F, P)$, representing arbitrary force components in location $x$ at time $t$. Then, for each pair of components $(i,j)$, the conditional contribution $C_{i,j}$ is defined as:
$$C_{i,j}:=\mathbb E\left[\frac{F_i}{|F_j|}\ \Big{|}\ \Phi=|F_j|\right],$$
where $\Phi=\Phi_2$ is the dominant force. In particular, for each component $i$, the dominance factor is defined as:
$$p_j:=P\left\{\Phi=|F_j|\right\}.$$
\end{definition}

In the following we display the contribution coefficients barplots as a function of time, for the locations $x_1,\dots,x_4$ defined above. Moreover, we report the dominance factors plots, a very useful tool to read the dynamical significance of the forces as a function of time and location.

\section*{Appendix A: Latin Hypercubes and orthogonal arrays - Andrea}
The Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) is a well established procedure for defining pseudo-random designs of samples in $\mathbb R^d$, with good properties with respect to the uniform probability distribution on an hypercube $[0,1]^d$ \citep{McKay1979,Owen1992b,Stein1987,Ranjan2014,Mingyao2016}. In particular, compared to a random sampling, a LHS: (i) enhances the capability to fill the d-dimensional space with a finite number of points, (ii) in case $d>1$, avoids the overlapping of point locations in the one dimensional projections, (iii) reduces the dependence of the number of points necessary on the dimensionality $d$.

\begin{definition}[Latin hypercube sampling]
Let $\Xi=\{\xi_i\ :\ i=1,\dots,N\}$ be a set of points inside the d-dimensional hypercube $C=[0,1]^d$. Let $[0,1]=\bigcup_{j=1}^{N} I_j$, where $I_j=[\frac{(j-1)}{N},\frac{j}{N}]$. Let $\xi_i=\left(\xi_i^1,\dots,\xi_i^d\right)$, and for each $k\in\{1,\dots,d\}$, let $\Xi^k=\{\xi^k_i\ :\ i=1,\dots,N\}$. Let $\lambda^d$ be the uniform probability measure supported inside $C$, called Lebesgue measure. Then $\Xi$ is a latin hypercube w.r.t. $\lambda^d$ $\Longleftrightarrow$ $\forall j\in \{1,\dots,N\}$, $\forall k\in\{1,\dots,d\}$, $\left|I_j\cap\Xi^k\right|=1$.
\end{definition}

The procedure is simple: once the desired number of samples $N\in\mathbb N$ is selected, and $[0,1]$ is divided in $N$ equal bins, then each bin will contain one and only one projection of the samples over every coordinate. The LHS definition is trivially generalized over $C=\prod^d_i [a_i, b_i]$, i.e. the cartesian product of $d$ arbitrary intervals. That will be applied in this study, defining LHS over the parameter domain of the flow models.

There are a large number of possible designs, corresponding the number of permutations of the bins in the d-projections, i.e. $d\cdot N!$. If the permutations are randomly sampled there is a high possibility that the design will have good properties. However, this is not assured, and clusters o points or regions of void space may be observed in $C$. For this reason, we base our design on the orthogonal arrays (OA) \citep{Owen1992a,Tang1993}.

\begin{definition}[Orthogonal arrays]
Let $S=\{1,\dots,s\}$, where $s\ge 2$. Let $Q\in S^{n\times m}$ be a matrix of such integer values. Then $Q$ is called an $OA(n,m,s,r)$ $\Longleftrightarrow$ each $n\times r$ submatrix of $Q$ contains all possible $1\times r$ row vectors with the same frequency $\lambda=n/s^r$, which is called the index of the array. In particular, $r$ is called the strength, $n$ the size, $(m\ge r)$ the constrains, and $s$ the levels of the array.
\end{definition}

Orthogonal arrays are very useful for defining latin hypercubes which are also forced to fill the space (or its r-dimensional subspaces) in a more robust way, at the cost of potentially requiring a larger number of points than a traditional LHS.

\begin{proposition}
Let $Q$ be an $OA(n,m,s,r)$. Then let $U\in\mathbb R^{n\times m}$ be defined as follows:
$$\forall k\in \{1,\dots,s\},\ \forall j\in \{1,\dots,m\},\ \left\{Q[\cdot,j]\ :\ Q[i,j]=k\right\} = \Pi\left(\{(k-1)\lambda s^{r-1},\dots, k\lambda s^{r-1}\}\right),$$
where $\Pi$ is a random permutation of $\lambda s^{r-1}$ elements. Then $\Xi=\{\xi_i=U[i,\cdot]\ :\ i=1,\dots,n\}$ is a LHS w.r.t to $\lambda^m$ over $C=[0,1]^m$. Moreover, let $[0,1]^r=\bigcup_{(h_1,\dots,h_r)=1}^{s} I_{(h_i)}$, where $I_{(h_i)}=\prod^r_i[\frac{(h_i-1)}{s},\frac{h_i}{s}]$. Then $\forall D=(d_1,\dots,d_r)\subseteq \{1,\dots,m\}$, let $\Xi^D=\{(\xi^{d_1},\dots,\xi^{d_r})\ :\ i=1,\dots,n\}$. We have that
$$\forall k\in \{1,\dots,s\},\ \forall (h_i\ : i=1,\dots,r)\in\{1,\dots,d\}^r,\ \left|I_{(k_i)}\cap\Xi^D\right|=\lambda.$$
\end{proposition}

For each column of $Q$ we are replacing the $\lambda s^{r-1}$ elements with entry $k$ by a random permutation of $\left((k-1)\lambda s^{r-1} + h\right)_{h\in 1,\dots, \lambda s^{r-1}}$. After the replacement procedure is done, the newly obtained matrix $U$ is equivalent to a LHS which inherits from $Q$ the property of fully covering $s^r$ equal r-dimensional hypercubes in every r-dimensional projection. Each hypercube contains $\lambda$ points. In other words, inside each r-dimensional projection, the design associated to $U$ fills the space like a regular grid at the scale of those $s^r$ hypercubes, but it is still an LHS at a finer scale, i.e. the $\lambda s^{r-1}$ one dimensional bins. A complete proof can be found in \cite{Tang1993} and it is a straightforward verification of the required properties.

However, even in an LHS based on an $OA(n,m,s,r)$, if $r<m$ what happens in the projections with dimension $r'>r$ is not controlled, and randomizing procedures are made more difficult by the additional structure imposed by the $OA$. Moreover, the total number of points necessary to achieve a full design increases with $r$, and hence is affected by dimensionality issues.

Dealing with relatively small $d$, i.e. $d\in\{3,4\}$, we adopt a LHS $U$ created by a $OA(s^d,d,s,d)$. The strength is equal to the dimension $d$, hence the design fills the entire space like a $d$ dimensional grid, but it is a LHS as well. In this case there is one point in each hypercube, and $\lambda=1$. We take $s=8$ for the 3-dimensional designs over the parameter space of Mohr-Coulomb and Voellmy-Salm models, i.e. $512$ points; we took $s=6$ for the 4-dimensional designs over the more complex parameter space of the Pouliquen-Forterre model, i.e. 1296 points.
