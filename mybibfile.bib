 abstract = {This paper uses orthogonal arrays to define generalizations of Latin hypercube sampling and of lattice sampling in the d dimensional unit cube. These are proposed as suitable designs for computer experiments, numerical integration and visualization. The orthogonal array based designs extend to t dimensional margins the univariate stratification properties of Latin hypercube and lattice sampling. As a consequence, the variance reduction property of Latin hypercube and lattice sampling also extends to orthogonal array based samples. We give a sample based estimate of the error variance in the case of bivariate stratification.},

 abstract = {Latin hypercube sampling (McKay, Conover, and Beckman 1979) is a method of sampling that can be used to produce input values for estimation of expectations of functions of output variables. The asymptotic variance of such an estimate is obtained. The estimate is also shown to be asymptotically normal. Asymptotically, the variance is less than that obtained using simple random sampling, with the degree of variance reduction depending on the degree of additivity in the function being integrated. A method for producing Latin hypercube samples when the components of the input variables are statistically dependent is also described. These techniques are applied to a simulation of the performance of a printer actuator.},

Besides preserving the univariate stratification properties of Latin hypercubes, these strength r OA-based Latin hypercubes also stratify each r-dimensional margin. Therefore, such OA-based Latin hypercubes provide more suitable designs for computer experiments and numerical integration than do general Latin hypercubes. We prove that when used for integration, the sampling scheme with OA-based Latin hypercubes offers a substantial improvement over Latin hypercube sampling.},

abstract = {High-fidelity computational simulation can be an invaluable tool in planning strategies for hazard risk mitigation. The accuracy and reliability of the predictions are crucial elements of these tools being successful. We present here a new simulation tool for dry granular avalanches using several new techniques for enhancing numerical solution accuracy. Highlights of our new methodology are the use of a depth-averaged model of the conservation laws and an adaptive grid Godunov solver to solve the resulting equations. The software is designed to run on distributed memory supercomputers and makes use of digital elevation data dynamically, i.e., refine the grid and input data to finer resolutions to better capture flow features as the flow evolves. Our simulations are validated using quantitative and qualitative comparisons to tabletop experiments and data from field observations. Our software is freely available and uses only publicly available libraries and hence can be used on a wide range of hardware and software platforms. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Pitman2005,
abstract = {Geophysical mass flows--debris flows, avalanches, landslides--can contain O(10(6)-10(10)) m(3) or more of material, often a mixture of soil and rocks with a significant quantity of interstitial fluid. These flows can be tens of meters in depth and hundreds of meters in length. The range of scales and the rheology of this mixture presents significant modelling and computational challenges. This paper describes a depth-averaged 'thin layer' model of geophysical mass flows containing a mixture of solid material and fluid. The model is derived from a 'two-phase' or 'two-fluid' system of equations commonly used in engineering research. Phenomenological modelling and depth averaging combine to yield a tractable set of equations, a hyperbolic system that describes the motion of the two constituent phases. If the fluid inertia is small, a reduced model system that is easier to solve may be derived.},

abstract = {This paper presents several standard and new methods for characterizing$\backslash$nthe effect of input data uncertainty on model output for hazardous$\backslash$ngeophysical mass flows. Note that we do not attempt here to characterize$\backslash$nthe inherent randomness of such flow events. We focus here on the$\backslash$nproblem of characterizing uncertainty in model output due to lack$\backslash$nof knowledge of such input for a particular event. Methods applied$\backslash$ninclude classical Monte Carlo and Latin hypercube sampling and more$\backslash$nrecent stochastic collocation, polynomial chaos, spectral projection$\backslash$nand a newly developed extension thereof named polynomial chaos quadrature.$\backslash$nThe simple and robust samplings based Monte Carlo type methods are$\backslash$nusually computationally intractable for reasonable physical models,$\backslash$nwhile the more sophisticated and computationally efficient polynomial$\backslash$nchaos method often breaks down for complex models. The spectral projection$\backslash$nand polynomial chaos quadrature methods discussed here produce results$\backslash$nof quality comparable to the polynomial chaos type methods while$\backslash$npreserving the simplicity and robustness of the Monte Carlo-type$\backslash$nsampling based approaches at much lower cost. The computational efficiency,$\backslash$nhowever, degrades with increasing numbers of random variables. A$\backslash$nprocedure for converting the output uncertainty characterization$\backslash$ninto a map showing the probability of a hazard threshold being exceeded$\backslash$nis also presented. The uncertainty quantification procedures are$\backslash$napplied first in simple settings to illustrate the procedure and$\backslash$nthen subsequently applied to the 1991 block-and-ash flows at Colima$\backslash$nVolcano, Mexico.},
