  abstract={The collapse and decrepitation of a lava dome at the summit of a volcano generally results in the generation of dense granular flows, often referred to as block and ash flows. As the dome particles propagate from the source, they break apart by internal pressure as well as collision. The propagation of block and ash flows can be simulated to some accuracy with a depth averaged numerical model of the equations of continuity and momentum for a material with a frictional resistance. However, important features of such flows, such as the influence of remote stress through force chains, erosion of the volcano substrate, and shock formation and pressurization upon particle break up are poorly understood. In the near future, the influence of these factors will be incorporated into depth averaged models. Various numerical techniques based on particles will some day yield results that can be compared not only with bulk flow properties, but to the internal layering of block and ash flow deposits.}

abstract="The mobility of gravity-driven granular flows such as debris flows or pyroclastic density currents are extremely sensitive to topographic changes, such as break in slopes, obstacles, or ravine deviations. In hazard assessment, computer codes can reproduce past events and evaluate hazard zonation based on inundation limits of simulated flows over a natural terrain. Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is a common input for the simulation algorithm and its accuracy to reproduce past flows is crucial. In this work, we use TITAN2D code to reproduce past block-and-ash flows at Colima volcano (Mexico) over DEMs with different cell size (5, 10, 30, 50, and 90Â m) in order to illustrate the influences of the resolution on the numeric simulations. Our results show that topographic resolution significantly affects the flow path and runout. Also, we found that simulations of past flows with the same input parameters (such as the basal friction angle) over topography with different resolutions resulted in different flow paths, areas, and thickness of the simulated flows. In particular, the simulations performed with the 5- and 10-m DEMs produced similar results. Also, we obtained consistent simulation results for the 30- and 50-m DEMs. However, for the coarser 90-m DEM results are largely different and inaccurate. We recommend generating a benchmark table in order to acquire characteristic values for the basal friction angle of studied events. In case of rugged topographies, a DEM with high resolution should be used for more confident results.",

abstract="Volc{\'a}n de Colima is one of the most active volcanoes in Mexico. Several hazard maps have been published based on reconstruction of the Late Pleistocene--Holocene eruptive history and historical records for the last 400Â years. Recent detailed published studies have improved the knowledge of the eruptive history of the volcano and proposed a new hazard zonation based on numerical simulation for debris avalanche, pyroclastic density currents (PDCs), debris flows and fallout events. The new hazard map incorporates all these new data and proposes a revised hazard zonation useful for improving decision-making both previously and during crises. A sub-Plinian to Plinian multi-stage eruption similar to the ad 1913 event would represent a major hazard for populated areas around Volc{\'a}n de Colima. PDCs initiated by column collapses could travel up to 15Â km from the eruptive vent. Tephra dispersal modeling shows that up to 10Â cm of fallout deposits could affect several cities (population more than{\textasciitilde}180,000 people). Lahars (including the wide spectra of volcaniclastic flows), the most common hazard during the rainy season, would affect the main ravines up to a distance of 15Â km from the Volc{\'a}n de Colima cone, impacting infrastructures and small villages. A Plinian eruption scenario also includes the possible generation of large volume lahars (up to 5Â {\texttimes}Â 106Â m3), possibly reaching major villages (i.e., San Marcos, Queser{\'i}a, Tonila) with catastrophic effects. Block-and-ash PDCs from summit dome collapse will travel in the main ravines up to distances between 4 and 7Â km, with slightly longer runout for associated turbulent PDCs. Despite a recurrence rate probably >2,000Â years, partial edifice collapse constitutes the major hazard. Large volume (>5Â km3) debris avalanches can disrupt the southern slopes of the volcano up to a distance of 30Â km affecting the Colima city, potentially associated with laterally directed blasts and secondary debris flows that in the past reached the Pacific coast.",

Using spatially varying bed friction angles, Titan2D is capable of reproducing the paths, velocities, runout distance, areas covered and deposited volumes of these flows over highly complex topography.

We first discuss the existence of a dense flow regime characterized by enduring contacts. We then emphasize that dimensional analysis strongly constrains the relation between stresses and shear rates, and show that results from experiments and simulations in different configurations support a description in terms of a frictional visco-plastic constitutive law. We then discuss the successes and limitations of this empirical rheology in light of recent alternative theoretical approaches. Finally, we briefly present depth-averaged methods developed for free surface granular flows. }}

The model{\textquoteright}s balance equations describe coupled evolution of the solid volume fraction, m, basal pore-fluid pressure, flow thickness and two components of flow velocity. Basal friction is evaluated using a generalized Coulomb rule, and fluid motion is evaluated in a frame of reference that translates with the velocity of the granular phase, vs. Source terms in each of the depth-averaged balance equations account for the influence of the granular dilation rate, defined as the depth integral of âˆ‡.vs. Calculation of the dilation rate involves the effects of an elastic compressibility and an inelastic dilatancy angle proportional to m-meq, where meq is the value of m in equilibrium with the ambient stress state and flow rate. Normalization of the model equations shows that predicted debris-flow behaviour depends principally on the initial value of m-meq and on the ratio of two fundamental timescales. One of these timescales governs downslope debris-flow motion, and the other governs pore-pressure relaxation that modifies Coulomb friction and regulates evolution of m. A companion paper presents a suite of model predictions and tests.},

The accuracy and reliability of the predictions are crucial elements of these tools being successful. We present here a new simulation tool for dry granular avalanches using several new techniques for enhancing numerical solution accuracy. Highlights of our new methodology are the use of a depth-averaged model of the conservation laws and an adaptive grid Godunov solver to solve the resulting equations. The software is designed to run on distributed memory supercomputers and makes use of digital elevation data dynamically, i.e., refine the grid and input data to finer resolutions to better capture flow features as the flow evolves. Our simulations are validated using quantitative and qualitative comparisons to tabletop experiments and data from field observations. Our software is freely available and uses only publicly available libraries and hence can be used on a wide range of hardware and software platforms. Â© 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Geophysical mass flows--debris flows, avalanches, landslides--can contain O(10(6)-10(10)) m(3) or more of material, often a mixture of soil and rocks with a significant quantity of interstitial fluid. These flows can be tens of meters in depth and hundreds of meters in length. The range of scales and the rheology of this mixture presents significant modelling and computational challenges. This paper describes a depth-averaged 'thin layer' model of geophysical mass flows containing a mixture of solid material and fluid. The model is derived from a 'two-phase' or 'two-fluid' system of equations commonly used in engineering research. Phenomenological modelling and depth averaging combine to yield a tractable set of equations, a hyperbolic system that describes the motion of the two constituent phases. If the fluid inertia is small, a reduced model system that is easier to solve may be derived.},

abstract="Numerical models for simulation of mass flows are typically focussed upon accurately predicting the paths, travel times and inundation from a single flow or collapse event. When considering catchment-based hazards from a volcano, this is complicated by often being faced with several possible scenarios. Over the last 800Â years at Mt. Taranaki/Egmont, a number of dome growth and collapse events have resulted in the genesis and emplacement of block-and-ash flows (BAFs). Each BAF was directed northwestward by a breach in the crater rim. The latest dome collapse events in the AD 1880s and AD 1755 inundated the northwestern flank and had run-out lengths 10Â km from source. Future activity of this type could have a devastating effect on the Taranaki region's communities, infrastructure and economy. Hazard planning has involved constructing volcanic hazard maps based upon the areas inundated by past volcanic flows, with little consideration of present-day topography. Here, a numerical geophysical mass flow modelling approach is used to forecast the hazards of future comparable BAF events on NW Mt. Taranaki. The Titan2D programme encompasses a ``shallow water'', continuum solution-based, granular flow model. Flow mechanical properties needed for this approach include estimates of internal and basal friction as well as the physical dimensions of the initial collapse. Before this model can be applied to Taranaki BAFs, the input parameters must be calibrated by simulating a range of past collapse events. By using AD 1860 and AD 1755 scenarios, initial collapse volumes can be well constrained and internal and basal friction angles can be evaluated through an iterative approach from previous run-out lengths. A range of possible input parameters was, therefore, determined to produce a suite of potentially inundated areas under present-day terrain. A suite of 10 forecasts from a uniformly distributed range were combined to create a map of relative probabilities of inundation by future BAF events. These results were combined in a GIS package to produce hazard zones related to user-specified hazard thresholds. Using these input parameter constraints, future hazard forecasts for this scale and type of event can also take into account changing summit and topographic configurations following future eruptive or collapse events.",

The eruption started in 17 January and peaked in 20 January, 1913. It occurred in three main phases: 1) An opening phase with the generation of Merapi-type pyroclastic flows (units F1, F2, F3) and a pyroclastic surge (S1), 2) A vent-clearing phase with strong explosions that produced Vulcanian-Soufriere-type pyroclastic flows (F4) and a pyroclastic surge (S2) which destroyed the summit dome decompressing the magma system, and 3) a Plinian phase with the establishment of a âˆ¼ 23 km high column dispersing a fallout (C1) to the \{NE\} followed by the collapse of the column that generated a pyroclastic surge (S3) and 15-km long pumice-rich pyroclastic flows (F5). After the eruption, remobilization of the pyroclastic material generated lahars in main gullies around the crater. Fallout \{C1\} blanketed an area of âˆ¼ 191,318 km2 covering the cities of Guzman, Guadalajara, and Saltillo (Coahuila) located at 725 km from the source. It had a volume of 1.4 km3 (0.57 km3 \{DRE\} = Dense Rock Equivalent). The total volume of pyroclastic flow and surge deposits was 0.26 km3 (0.07 km3 DRE) giving a total volume of the eruption of 1.66 km3 (0.64 km3 DRE). The Plinian column lasted 4.6 h with a total mass of 1.5e12 kg and a mass eruption rate of 9.02e7 kg/s. The column height and the ejected magma volume indicate that the 1913 eruption had a \{VEI\} = 5 being the largest event in the historical record of Colima Volcano. Juvenile scoria and pumice consisted of Pl &gt; Opx &gt; Cpx &gt; Hbl + accessory titanomagnetite + Ap and Ol with reaction rims. Chemistry of juvenile scoria and pumice samples is andesitic very homogeneous (58.3 Â± 0.5 wt.% SiO2) and similar to the 1818 juvenile products (58.9 Â± 0.2 wt.% SiO2). The presence of banded scoria, olivine phenocrysts with reaction rims, and trace element variations strongly suggest that the 1913 eruption was caused by a magma mixing event. "

abstract="Digital elevation models (DEMs) used in geospatial analysis like the simulation of geophysical flows, such as floods, landslides, and block and ash flows, differ in resolution, acquisition time and generation methodology, which results in varied representation of topographic features. This study investigates the effects of DEMs on the output of a granular flow model, TITAN2D by comparing the output using different DEMs to that obtained with a ``true'' representation of the terrain, which is considered to be that obtained by using TOPSAR 5Â m data. Seven DEMs at four resolutions from four sources were used for Mammoth Mountain, California, a cumulodome volcano. TITAN2D was run for seven different locations of an eruption of a potential dome and two different collapse volumes. The resulting outputs were subsequently compared with TOPSAR 5Â m output, and qualitative and statistical inferences were drawn. DEMs with different resolutions and sources generated different outputs that led to different flow maps. For moderate and smaller scale flows (                                                                          {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}O{\}}(10^4){\$}{\$}                 m3 --                                                                           {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}O{\}}(10^5) {\backslash},{\backslash}text{\{}m{\}}^3{\$}{\$}                ), different representations can affect the computation of accurate footprint of the flow and fine DEM resolution is critical for correct characterization of these flows.",

Integrating these variations in the possible flows as a function of input uncertainties provides well-defined hazard probabilities at specific locations, i.e. a hazard map. Earlier work provided a methodology for assessing hazards based on variations in flow initiation and friction parameters. This paper extends this approach to include the effect of terrain error and uncertainty. The results are based on potential flows at Mammoth Mountain, CA, and Galeras Volcano, Colombia. The analysis establishes the soundness of the approach and the effect of including the uncertainty in DEMs in the construction of probabilistic hazard maps.},

The asymptotic variance of such an estimate is obtained. The estimate is also shown to be asymptotically normal. Asymptotically, the variance is less than that obtained using simple random sampling, with the degree of variance reduction depending on the degree of additivity in the function being integrated. A method for producing Latin hypercube samples when the components of the input variables are statistically dependent is also described. These techniques are applied to a simulation of the performance of a printer actuator.},

abstract="Simultaneous seismic and video monitoring of the January 2013--June 2014 eruptive episode at the andesitic Volc{\'a}n de Colima, M{\'e}xico, allowed a detailed study of dynamics of eruption processes. The episode developed in two main phases: explosive, consisting of four Vulcanian explosions between 6 to 29 January 2013, and effusive, when the new crater excavated by the explosive sequence was filled, and a lava cap partially covered the 2007--2011 lava dome increasing the height of the lava dome in the crater from 3,854 to 3,881Â m. The volume of this new lava dome above the reference level of 3,836Â m was estimated as 1.3{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}106Â m3. The mean rate of magma discharge during the growth of the new lava dome was estimated as 0.27Â m3/s. Lava effusion was effectively finished by October 2013. The period from November 2013 to July 2014 was characterized by a gradual decrease in the number of small explosions and rockfalls. A conceptual model of this eruption episode is proposed. The ascent of magma began in the conduit at the depths of about 1,000Â m beneath the crater according to the locations of explosive earthquakes. The January explosive sequence opened a pathway of magma to the surface. The ascending magma filled the western part of the crater forming a new lava dome.",
