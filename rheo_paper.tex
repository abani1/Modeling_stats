\abstract
Dense large scale granular avalanches are a complex class of flows with physics that has often been poorly captured by models that are computationally tractable. Sparsity of actual flow data (usually only a posteriori deposit information is available), and large uncertainty in the mechanisms of initiation and flow propagation, make the modeling task challenging, and a subject of much continuing interest. Models that appear to represent the physics well in certain flows, may turn out to be poorly behaved in others, due to intrinsic mathematical or numerical issues. Nevertheless, given the large implications on life and property, many models with different modeling assumptions have been proposed.

While inverse problems can shed some light on parameter choices, it is difficult to make firm judgements on the validity or appropriateness of any single or set of modeling assumptions for a particular target flow, or potential flows, that needs to be modeled for predictive use in hazard analysis. We present here an uncertainty quantification based approach to carefully analyze the effect of several modeling assumptions on quantities of interest in simulations based on three established models, i.e Mohr-Coulomb, Pouliquen-Forterre and Voellmy-Salm. In doing this, we take advantage of the versatile implementation of all the models on the same infrastructure, given by TITAN2D.

Statistical analysis is performed on spatially averaged dynamical quantities, but also focusing on locally sampled points of interest. This enables us to exploit the significant differences that remain hidden in the averaged analysis. The fundamental focus of this paper is the exploration of the dynamics of the simulated flows, enabling a notion of the contribution of different mechanisms or models elements inside the simulation procedure, in a fully quantitative, predictive-use oriented and statistical framework.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Intro}

\subsection{Geophysical mass flows}\label{subsec:FlowTypes}
Geophysical mass flows include debris and mud flows, landslides, snow and rock avalanches, glacier flows, pyroclastic surges, block and ash flows, and pumice flows, lahars, j\"okulhaups and many other examples. These flows are sometimes tens of kilometers in length and may travel at speeds as fast as hundreds of meters per second. Their deposits can be as much as tens of meters deep and kilometers long. In other words, there is no single universal description of a ``typical'' geophysical mass flow. Different types of flows are the results of different types of mechanisms/processes and hence different types of flows will have significantly different physical characteristics.

The rheology complexity of the fluidized material, and the mathematical problem of modeling and computing, make the description of the dynamics of those flows really challenging. In many cases the flows are \emph{shallow}, i.e. the horizontal dimension is significantly larger than the flow depth. This assumption allows to perform depth-integration on the governing 3D Navier-Stokes equations, resulting in the 2D formulation of Shallow Water Equations (SWE), also known as Saint Venant Equations \citep{Batchelor2000, Luca2016}. Pioneering work of \cite{SavageHutter1989} that was followed by \cite{Hutter1993,DadeHuppert1998} developed a depth-averaged model for flow of granular materials. Their model was used to model a flow of granular material down an inclined plane, originally using the Mohr-Coulomb rheology (MC) (see also \cite{Jaeger1989,FraccarolloToro1995}). Afterwards, large number of studies focused on the modeling of granular flows, including geophysical mass flows, using SWE approach and many of them were carefully reviewed in \cite{PudasainiHutter2007}.

Modeling flow of granular material down an inclined plane was explored in detail by several further studies, both theoretically and experimentally \citep{Pouliquen1999, RuyerQuil2000, Silbert2001, Bursik2005, DaCruz2005}. Granular material slumping \citep{Balmforth2005,Lajeunesse2005}, rapid flow down smooth inclines \citep{Greve1994,Wieland1999} and shock waves \citep{Gray2003,Hokanardottir2005} were modeled and tested. Terrain erosion effects were investigated \citep{Pitman2003b, Edwards2015}, and also material deposition and self-channeling effects \citep{Mangeney2005, Mangeney2007}.

In particular, the experiments on rough inclined planes led to the development of the Pouliquen-Forterre rheology (PF), assuming a variable frictional behavior as a function of flow regime (i.e. Froude Number, $Fr$) and flow depth \citep{Pouliquen1999, ForterrePouliquen2002, PouliquenForterre2002, ForterrePouliquen2003}. They allowed for an improved modeling of front propagation, mass spreading, surface wave-propagation and vortices-evolution in the flows on a rough terrain \citep{Forterre2006, Jop2006, ForterrePouliquen2008}.

In parallel to and sometimes anticipating the earth avalanches experiments and models, study of snow avalanches led to the development of the Voellmy-Salm rheology (VS) \citep{Voellmy1955, Salm1990, Salm1993, Bartelt1999}. Dense snow or debris avalanches consist of mobilized, rapidly flowing ice-snow mixed to debris-rock granules \citep{BarteltMcArdell2009}. The VS rheology assumes a velocity dependent resisting term in addition to the traditional basal friction, ideally capable of including an approximation of the turbulence-generated friction. Many experimental and theoretical studies were developed in this framework \citep{Gruber2007, Kern2009, Christen2010, Fischer2012}.

In \cite{Iverson1997, Iverson2001, Denlinger2001, Denlinger2004, Iverson2004}, the depth-averaged model was further studied and applied in the simulation of geophysical flows over digital models of natural terrains. Moreover, \cite{Gray1999, Gray2003} tested modeling of fast avalanches, exploring the high-velocity effects of channelizing/chuting topographies. A compensation for the effect of earth pressure changes was implemented and explored in detail \citep{Pirulli2007,Pirulli2008}, as well as the implementation of a significant curvature in the terrain \citep{PudasainiHutter2003, Fischer2012}. Several specific studies on the pore pressure effects on the flow initiation and fluidization were developed \citep{SavageIverson2003, Iordanoff2004, Iverson2014}. A two-phase model was also implemented to more accurately simulate heterogenous flows with a significant portion of interstitial fluid \citep{PitmanLe2005}. All of these complex modeling choices correspond to alternative or additional physical assumptions, and they are sometimes very difficult to be evaluated, compared or reasonably combined together.

A particular interest is raised by the specific efforts devoted to the modeling of volcanic mass flows with SWE \citep{FreundtBursik1998,Bursik2005,Saucedo2005, Kelfoun2005,Charbonnier2009,Kelfoun2009,Procter2010,Sulpizio2010,Kelfoun2011,Charbonnier2013}. Volcanoes are great sources for a rich variety of geophysical flow types in addition to the collected field data from past flow events.

In this study, we use TITAN2D software that is a publicly available toolkit for simulation of granular flows over natural terrains by solving depth-averaged equations using Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of terrain \citep{Pitman2003a, Patra2005, Patra2006, Yu2009, Aghakhani2016}. In the $\mathrm{4^{\mathrm{th}}}$ release of TITAN2D, the capability of having multiple rheology options (MC, PF and VS rheologies) for simulation of flow in the same computational platform have been implemented. Therefore, we can perfectly make use of this opportunity and only focus on modeling characteristics of these rheology options without concerns about effects of diverse numerical frameworks. So far, TITAN2D achieved many successful applications in the simulation of different geophysical mass flows with specific peculiarities \citep{Sheridan2005, Rupp2006, Norini2008, Charbonnier2009, Procter2010, Sheridan2010, Sulpizio2010, Capra2011}. Several studies involving TITAN2D were recently directed towards a statistical study of geophysical flows, focusing on the uncertainty quantification and propagation \citep{Dalbey2008, Dalbey2009, Stefanescu2012b, Stefanescu2012a}, or on the more efficient production of hazard maps \citep{Bayarri2009, Spiller2014,Bayarri2015, Ogburn2016}.

This study for the first time applies a statistical approach to the detailed investigation of the material model \emph{stress components} and their associated \emph{powers}, as well as the \emph{Froude Number} $Fr$, the \emph{acceleration} and observable quantities as the flow \emph{velocity}, \emph{height}, \emph{lateral extent}, and \emph{area}. The stress components have a strong link with the dynamic equation terms, while $Fr$ can give information on the flow regime; moreover, the observable quantities have a direct link to field data and hazard assessments. This can provide a complete description of the geophysical flow. Our main purpose is to obtain a quantitative and statistical understanding of the consequences of the different physical assumptions, both on the forces inside the flow and on the observable outputs in time and space.

In particular, what we present is a procedure for the improved exploration and quantitative comparison of physical models and their assumptions through the collection of full statistical data. Behind each physical model there are different physical assumptions, and therefore it is more appropriate to look at those instead than at the entire model results. Our statistical approach shall enable a first step towards a data driven selection of the best modeling assumptions to use.

    \label{fig:Ramp-first}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Overview of the case studies}
The first case study assumes very simple boundary conditions, and corresponds to an experiment fully described in \cite{Webb2004, Bursik2005, WebbBursik2016}. It is a classical flow down an inclined plane set-up, including a change in slope to an horizontal plane (Fig. \ref{fig:Ramp-first}). Four locations are selected among the center line of the flow to accomplish local testing. These are: the initial pile location $L_1=(-0.7,0)$ m, the middle of the inclined plane $L_2=(-0.35,0)$ m, the change in slope $L_3=(0,0)$ m, the middle of the flat plane $L_4=(0.15,0)$ m (see Section \ref{sec:QoIs}).

The second case study is a block and ash flow down the slope of Volc{\'a}n de Colima (M{\'e}xico) - an andesitic stratovolcano that rises to 3,860 m above sea level, situated in the western portion of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (Fig. \ref{fig:Colima-first}). Historically, it has been the most active volcano in M{\'e}xico \citep{DeLaCruzReina1993, Zobin2002, Gonzalez2002}. The modeling of pyroclastic flows generated by explosive eruptions and lava dome collapses of Volc{\'a}n de Colima is a well studied problem \citep{DelPozzo1995,Sheridan1995,Saucedo2002,Saucedo2004,Saucedo2005, Sarocchi2011, Capra2015}. The volcano has been already used as a case study in several research involving the Titan2D code \citep{Rupp2004, Rupp2006, Dalbey2008, Yu2009, Sulpizio2010, Capra2011, Aghakhani2016}. During July 10$^{\mathrm{th}}$-11$^{\mathrm{th}}$, 2015, the volcano underwent its most intense eruptive phase since its Subplinian-Plinian 1913 AD eruption \citep{Saucedo2010, Zobin2015, ReyesDaVilla2016, Capra2016, Macorps2017}.

Six points that are adopted as preferred locations are highlighted in yellow. Elevation isolines are included in blue, elevation values in red.}
    \label{fig:Colima-first}
\end{figure}

We assume the flow to be generated by the gravitational collapse of a material pile placed close to the summit area. The volcano already produced either pyroclastic flows generated by lava dome collapse, sometimes called Merapi style flows, or by an eruptive column partial collapse, Soufriere style \citep{Macorps2017}. A dome collapse occurs when there is a significant amount of recently-extruded highly-viscous lava piled up in an unstable configuration around a vent. Further extrusion and/or externals forces can cause the still hot dome of viscous lava to collapse, disintegrate, and avalanche downhill \citep{Bursik2005, Wolpert2016}. Eruptive column collapse can occur during explosive eruptions, when the eruption column can no longer
sustain the weight of material due to loss of pressure, and hence it partially collapses down. The hot, dense blocks in this ``block and ash'' flow (BAF) will typically range from centimeters to a few meters in size. The matrix is composed of fine ash from the comminuted blocks. Computations were performed on a DEM with 5m-pixel resolution, obtained from LiDAR data acquired in 2005 \citep{Davila2007, Sulpizio2010}. We select 51 locations along the flow inundated area to accomplish local testing. Six of them are then adopted as preferred locations, being representative of different flow regimes (see Section \ref{QoI2}).


\section{Overview of the models}\label{sec:GeoPhFlows}

\subsection{Modeling Assumptions}\label{subsec:ModelAssump}
The models of geophysical mass flows described in this study rely on several physical and mathematical assumptions. We will classify them in two groups - the general assumptions and the rheology assumptions. The main focus of this study is on the latter group, but, in principle, the same procedure could be applied to the former.

\paragraph{General Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
\item The \textit{shallowness} approximation is at the base of the depth-averaging procedure. In this approximation, the flow depth is assumed to be at least an order of magnitude less than the characteristic length of the flowing material. Variation of velocity within the flow depth is neglected.

\item The material is assumed to be \textit{continuous}. The real flows consist of granular material and, often, interstitial fluid. Usually the ``typical particle'' diameter is small compared to the depth and length of the flowing mass, and the rheological properties are imposed to approximate the bulk behavior that is expected of an actual mass flow.

\item The moving mass is assumed to be \textit{volume preserving}. In contrast, phenomena of erosion and deposition of material may violate this assumption.

\item The flowing mass is assumed to be consisted of an \textit{incompressible} fluid. This means that we are ignoring variations of density due to the void ratio (i.e. the density is uniform in space and time).

\item The body of mass is supposed to be in \textit{isothermal} state or, if not, thermal effects can be ignored.

\item The mass flow is assumed to be \textit{free surface}. Air entrainment is instead frequently observed in the dilute real flows.

\item The stress tensor is assumed \textit{symmetric} with respect to the \textit{z} axis.
\end{itemize}

The shallowness assumption is very important, and brings several implications which may be considered additional assumptions on their own.

\paragraph{Consequences of Shallowness}
\begin{itemize}
\item The shallowness assumption implies a \textit{hydrostatic} expression for the normal pressure in the direction perpendicular to the basal surface. Moreover, the downslope and cross-slope pressure components are assumed to be varying linearly with the normal pressure component through the flow depth.

\item The \textit{boundary layer} where the shearing deformation takes place is collapsed to zero thickness. The sliding and shearing velocity are combined to a single sliding law with a somewhat larger modelled sliding velocity.

\item The \textit{lateral shear stresses can be neglected}, compared to the basal shear stresses. Motion of the bulk of mass consists of ``shearing within the deforming mass'' and ``sliding along the basal surface''.
\end{itemize}

The list rheology assumptions is detailed when the models are presented.



\subsection{Governing Equations and Boundary Conditions}\label{subsec:GovEqsBCs}
The motion of the mass flow is described by the basic conservation of mass and momentum for an incompressible medium:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:N_S}
\nabla \cdot\underline{{\textbf u}} &=& 0, \nonumber \\
\dfrac{\partial}{\dt}(\rho \ \underline{{\textbf u}})+\nabla \cdot (\rho \ \underline{{\textbf u}}\otimes \underline{{\textbf u}}) &=& \nabla \cdot \underline{\underline{{\mathbf{T}}}}+\rho \ \underline{{\textbf g}},
\end{eqnarray}
Where $\underline{{\textbf u}}=[u, v, w]^{\mathrm{T}}$ is the material velocity in cartesian coordinates, $\rho$ is its constant density, $\underline{\underline{{\mathbf{T}}}}$ is the \textit{Cauchy} stress tensor, and $\underline{{\textbf g}}$ is the gravity acceleration vector.

The Cauchy stress tensor, $\underline{\underline{{\mathbf{T}}}}$, depends on the rheology assumptions. The kinetic boundary conditions are defined on the free surface $F^s=s(x,y,t)-z=0$ and basal surface $F^b=b(x,y,t)-z=0$ interfaces:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:SurKinBC}
\frac{\partial F^s}{\dt} + \underline{{\textbf u}}\cdot\nabla F^s = 0, \ \ at \ F^s(x,y,t)=0
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:BedKinBC}
\frac{\partial F^b}{\dt} + \underline{{\textbf u}}\cdot\nabla F^b = 0, \ \ at \ F^b(x,y,t)=0
\end{equation}

The depth-averaged Saint-Venant equations that TITAN2D solves are:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:D_A}
\frac{\partial h}{\partial t} +
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(h \bar{u}) +
\frac{\partial}{\partial y}(h\bar{v}) &=& 0, \nonumber \\
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} (h\bar{u}) +
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(h\bar{u}^2 + \frac{1}{2}k g_{z}h^2\right) + \frac{\partial}{\partial y}(h\bar{u}\bar{v}) &=& S_{x},\\
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} (h\bar{v}) +
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(h\bar{u}\bar{v}) +
\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(h\bar{v}^2 + \frac{1}{2}k g_{z}h^2\right) &=& S_{y}\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
Here the cartesian coordinate system is aligned such that $z$ is normal to the surface; $h$ is the flow height in the $z$ direction; $h\bar{u}$ and $h\bar{v}$ are respectively the components of momentum in the $x$ and $y$ directions; and $k$ is the coefficient which relates the lateral stress components, $\bar{\sigma}_{xx}$ and $\bar{\sigma}_{yy}$, to the normal stress component, $\bar{\sigma}_{zz}$. The definition of this coefficient depends on the constitutive model of the flowing material we choose. Note that $\frac{1}{2} k g_z h^2$ is the contribution of hydrostatic pressure to the momentum fluxes. $S_x$ and $S_y$ are the sum local stresses: they include the gravitational driving forces, the basal friction force resisting to the motion of the material, and additional forces specific of rheology assumptions.

\subsubsection{Numerical solver}\label{NumS}
Let $\textbf{U}=\left[h, \ h\bar{u}, \ h\bar{v}\right]^T$ be the vector of conservative variables and $\textbf{F}=\left[h\bar{u}, \ h\bar{u}^2+0.5 k_{ap} g_z h^2, \ h\bar{v}\bar{u}\right]^T$ and $\textbf{G}=\left[h\bar{v}, \ h\bar{u}\bar{v}, \ h\bar{v}^2+0.5 k_{ap} g_z h^2\right]^T$ be the physical flux vectors.
In order to solve the system of hyperbolic conservation laws (\ref{eq:D_A}), TITAN2D employs a finite volume Godunov solver, and the time-stepping procedure is achieved by an explicit Euler scheme \citep{Pitman2003a, Patra2005, Patra2006}. Assuming $\textbf{S}=\left[S_h, \ S_x, \ S_y\right]^T$ as the source terms vector containing the effect of the flow rheology, the flow in the next time step updates as:
\begin{equation}\label{integrator}
\textbf{U}_{i,j}^{n+1} = \textbf{U}_{i,j}^n - \frac{\bigtriangleup t}{\bigtriangleup x} \{\textbf{F}_{i+\frac{1}{2},j}^n - \textbf{F}_{i-\frac{1}{2},j}^n \} - \frac{\bigtriangleup t}{\bigtriangleup y} \{\textbf{G}_{i,j+\frac{1}{2}}^n - \textbf{G}_{i,j-\frac{1}{2}}^n \} + \bigtriangleup t \ \textbf{S}_{i,j}
\end{equation}
Where $\textbf{F}_{i\pm\frac{1}{2},j}^n$ and $\textbf{G}_{i,j\pm\frac{1}{2}}^n$ are the numerical flux terms at the inter-cell boundaries which are computed regarding the Harten-Lax-Van Leer Riemann solver \citep{Toro2013} . In fact, the evolution of the flow to the next time step depends on the advection flux at the cell interface, which results from the wave interaction at the boundaries between cells.
On the other hand, adaptive mesh refinement allows for the concentration of computing power on regions of special interest. It captures the complex flow features along the flow boundaries, as well as the locations where there are large mass or momentum fluxes (which may include places where the topography changes abruptly). Mesh coarsening is also applied where the solution values are relatively constant or small to further improve the computational efficiency \citep{Patra2005,Aghakhani2016}.

\subsection{Rheology assumptions}\label{subsec:Models}
In the three following sections, we briefly describe \emph{Mohr-Coulomb} (MC), \emph{Pouliquen-Forterre} (PF) and \emph{Voellmy-Salm} (VS) models.

\subsubsection{Mohr-Coulomb model}\label{MCM}
Based on the long history of studies in soil mechanics \citep{Rankine1857}, the Mohr-Coulomb rheology model was developed and used to represent the behavior of geophysical mass flows \cite{SavageHutter1989}.

Shear and normal stress are assumed to obey Coulomb friction equation, both within the flow and at its boundaries. In other words,
\begin{equation}
\tau = \sigma \tan \phi,
\end{equation}
where $\tau$ and $\sigma$ are respectively the shear and normal stresses on failure surfaces, and $\phi$ is a friction angle. This relationship does not depend on the flow speed.

Under the assumption of symmetry of the stress tensor w.r.t. the \textit{z} axis, the earth pressure coefficient $k=k_{ap}$ can take on only one of three values indicated by the square dots shown in Figure \ref{mohr_circle}. The material yield criterion is represented by the two straight lines at angles $\pm \phi$ (the internal friction angle) relative to horizontal direction. Similarly, the normal and shear stress at the bed are represented by the line $\tau=-\sigma \tan(\delta)$ where $\delta$ is the bed friction angle. The three possible stress states in the \textit{xz}-plane are indicated by the square dots. The circular dots show the additional possible stress states for $\sigma_{yy}$ for a non-axisymmetric stress tensor.

\begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{Figures/mohr.jpg}
        \caption{Mohr-circle-diagram representing the stress state within a granular medium \citep{Pirulli2007}.}
        \label{mohr_circle}
\end{figure}

Regarding the friction angle stated above, we have two material properties in this model:
\begin{itemize}
\item Internal friction angle, $\phi_{int}$, which resists material shear.
\item Bed friction angle, $\phi_{bed}$, which resists motion of the material relative to the bed. This is a joint property of the material and the surface it flows over.
\end{itemize}
It is worth mentioning that the effective value of the friction angles can be strongly reduced by the presence of interstitial fluid, sometimes creating modeling issues. Specific models have been developed in case the effect of interstitial fluid is believed to be particularly relevant \citep{PitmanLe2005}.

\paragraph{Earth pressure coefficient} $k=k_{ap}$ is defined in MC as:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{k_ap}
k_{ap} = \begin{cases}
\frac{\sigma_{xx}^{b \ act}}{\sigma_{zz}^b}=2\frac{1-\sqrt{1-\cos^2(\phi_{int})(1+\tan^2 (\phi_{bed}))}}{\cos^2(\phi_{int})}-1, & \nabla \cdot \underset{^\sim}{\bar{\textbf u}}>0, \ active\\
\frac{\sigma_{xx}^{b}}{\sigma_{zz}^b}=1, & \nabla \cdot \underset{^\sim}{\bar{\textbf u}}=0, \ neutral\\
\frac{\sigma_{xx}^{b \ pass}}{\sigma_{zz}^b}=2\frac{1+\sqrt{1-\cos^2(\phi_{int})(1+\tan^2 (\phi_{bed}))}}{\cos^2(\phi_{int})}-1, & \nabla \cdot \underset{^\sim}{\bar{\textbf u}}<0, \ passive
\end{cases}
\end{eqnarray}

\paragraph{MC equations} As a result, we can write down the source terms of the Eqs. (\ref{eq:D_A}):
\begin{eqnarray}\label{S_terms_MC}
S_x = g_x h  - \frac{\bar{u}}{\| \underset{^\sim}{\bar{\textbf u}} \|} \left[h\left(g_z+\frac{\bar{u}^2}{r_x}\right)\tan(\phi_{bed})\right] - h k_{ap} \ {\rm sgn}\left(\frac{\partial \bar{u}}{\partial y}\right) \frac{\partial (g_z h)}{\partial y} \sin(\phi_{int}),\nonumber \\
S_y = g_y h  - \frac{\bar{v}}{\| \underset{^\sim}{\bar{\textbf u}} \|} \left[h\left(g_z +\frac{\bar{v}^2}{r_y}\right)\tan(\phi_{bed})\right] - h k_{ap} \ {\rm sgn}\left({\frac{\partial \bar{v}}{\partial x}}\right) \frac{\partial (g_z h)}{\partial x} \sin(\phi_{int})
\end{eqnarray}
Where, $\underset{^\sim}{\bar{\textbf u}} = (\bar{u} , \bar{v})$, is the depth-averaged velocity vector, $r_x$ and $r_y$ denote the radii of curvature
of the local basal surface. The inverse of the radii of curvature is usually approximated with the partial derivatives of the basal slope, e.g., $1/r_x = \partial \theta_x/\partial x$, where $\theta_x$ is the local bed slope.

\paragraph{MC rheology assumptions} In summary:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Basal Friction} is based on a constant friction angle.

\item \textit{Internal Friction} gives a not negligible contribution and it is based on a constant friction angle.

\item \textit{Earth pressure coefficient} formula depends on the Mohr-Coulomb circle.

\item Velocity based \textit{curvature effects} are included into the equations.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Pouliquen-Forterre model}\label{PFM}
The scaling properties for granular flows down rough inclined planes led to a new formulation of the basal friction stress as a function of the flow depth and velocity \citep{Pouliquen1999}.

Two critical slope inclination angles are defined as functions of the flow thickness, namely $\phi_{start}(h)$ and $\phi_{stop}(h)$. The function $\phi_{stop}(h)$ gives the slope angle at which a steady uniform flow leaves a deposit of thickness $h$, while $\phi_{start}(h)$ is the angle at which a layer of thickness $h$ is mobilized. They define two different basal friction coefficients:
\begin{eqnarray}
\mu_{start}(h)=\tan(\phi_{start}(h))\\
\mu_{stop}(h)=\tan(\phi_{stop}(h))
\end{eqnarray}

An empirical friction law $\mu_{b}(\|\underset{^\sim}{\bar{\textbf{u}}} \| , h)$ is then defined in the whole range of velocity and thickness. The expression changes depending on two flow regimes, according to a parameter $\beta$ and the Froude number $Fr=\| \underset{^\sim}{\bar{\textbf{u}}} \| / \ \sqrt{h g_{z}}$.

\paragraph{Dynamic friction regime - $Fr \ge \beta$}
\begin{equation}\label{mu_beta1}
\mu(h, Fr)=\mu_{stop}(h \beta / Fr)
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Intermediate friction regime - $0 \le Fr < \beta$}
\begin{equation}\label{mu_beta2}
\mu(h, Fr)=\left(\frac{Fr}{\beta}\right)^\gamma [\mu_{stop}(h)-\mu_{start}(h)] + \mu_{start}(h),
\end{equation}
where $\gamma$ is the power of extrapolation, assumed equal to $10^{-3}$ in the sequel \citep{PouliquenForterre2002}. In particular, if $Fr=\beta$, then $\mu(h, Fr)=\mu_{stop}(h)$, and if $Fr = 0$, then $\mu(h, Fr)=\mu_{start}(h)$.

The functions $\mu_{stop}$ and $\mu_{start}$ are defined by:
\begin{equation}\label{mu-stop}
\mu_{stop}(h)=\tan\phi_{1} + \frac{\tan\phi_{2}-\tan\phi_{1}}{1+h/\it \mathcal{L}}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{mu-start}
\mu_{start}(h)=\tan\phi_{3} + \frac{\tan\phi_{2}-\tan\phi_{1}}{1+h/\it \mathcal{L}}
\end{equation}
The critical angles $\phi_{1}$, $\phi_{2}$ and $\phi_{3}$ and the parameters $\mathcal{L}, \beta$ are the parameters of the model.

In particular, $\mathcal{L}$ is the characteristic depth of the flow over which a transition between the angles $\phi_{1}$ to $\phi_{2}$ occurs, in the $\mu_{stop}$ formula. In practice, if $h\ll \mathcal L$, then $\mu_{stop}(h)\approx \tan\phi_{2}$, and if $h\gg \mathcal L$, then $\mu_{stop}(h)\approx\tan\phi_{1}$. The effect of the topographic local curvatures is also taken into account.

\paragraph{PF equations} The depth-averaged Eqs. (\ref{eq:D_A}) source terms thus take the following form:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:S_terms_PF}
S_{x} &=&  g_{x} h -  \frac{\bar{u}}{\| \underset{^\sim}{\bar{\textbf{u}}} \|}\left[h \left(g_z+\frac{\bar{u}^2}{r_x}\right) \ \mu_{b}(\|\underset{^\sim}{\bar{\textbf{u}}} \| , h)\right] \ + g_{z}h\frac{\partial h}{\partial x} \nonumber \\
S_{y} &=&  g_{y} h - \frac{\bar{v}}{\| \underset{^\sim}{\bar{\textbf{u}}} \|}\left[h \left(g_z +\frac{\bar{v}^2}{r_y}\right) \ \mu_{b}(\|\underset{^\sim}{\bar{\textbf{u}}} \| , h)\right] \ + g_{z}h\frac{\partial h}{\partial y}
\end{eqnarray}

\paragraph{PF rheology assumptions} In summary:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Basal Friction} is based on an interpolation of different friction angles, based on the flow regime and depth.

\item \textit{Internal Friction} is neglected.

\item \textit{Earth pressure coefficient} is equal to one.

\item Normal stress is modified by a \textit{hydrostatic pressure force} related to the flow height gradient.

\item Velocity based \textit{curvature effects} are included into the equations.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Voellmy-Salm model}\label{VSM}
The theoretical analysis of dense snow avalanches led to the VS rheology model \citep{Voellmy1955, Salm1993}. The following relation between shear and normal stresses holds:
\begin{equation}
\tau = \mu \sigma + \frac{\rho \| \underline{\textbf g} \|}{\xi} \| \underset{^\sim}{\bar{\textbf u}} \|^2,
\end{equation}
where, $\sigma$ denotes the normal stress at the bottom of the fluid layer and $\underline{\textbf g} = (g_{x} , g_{y} , g_{z})$ represents the gravity vector. The VS rheology adds a velocity dependent \emph{turbulent} friction to the traditional velocity independent basal friction term which is proportional to the normal stress at the flow bottom. The two parameters of the model are the bed friction coefficient $\mu$ and the turbulent friction coefficient $\xi$. By dimension analysis, $\xi$ is equivalent to an acceleration, while $\mu$ is dimensionless. The decomposition of the total basal friction into velocity independent and dependent parts allows the modeling of either the dynamic regime when the avalanche is flowing with a high velocity in the acceleration zone, and when it is close to stopping in the runout zone.

The effect of the topographic local curvatures is again taken into account by adding the terms containing the local radii of curvature $r_x$ and $r_y$. In this case the formula is considering the modulus of velocity instead than the scalar component \citep{Fischer2012}.

\paragraph{VS equations} Therefore, the final source terms take the following form:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:S_terms_VS}
S_{x} &=&  g_{x} h - \frac{\bar{u}}{\| \underset{^\sim}{\bar{\textbf u}}\|} \ \left[ h \left(g_{z} + \frac{\| \underset{^\sim}{\bar{\textbf u}} \|^2}{r_{x}} \right)\mu+ \frac{\| \underset{^\sim}{\textbf g} \|}{\xi}\| \underset{^\sim}{\bar{\textbf u}} \|^2\right], \nonumber \\
S_{y} &=& g_{y} h - \frac{\bar{v}}{\| \underset{^\sim}{\bar{\textbf u}}\|} \ \left[ h \left(g_{z} + \frac{\| \underset{^\sim}{\bar{\textbf u}} \|^2}{r_{y}} \right)\mu+ \frac{\| \underset{^\sim}{\textbf g} \|}{\xi}\| \underset{^\sim}{\bar{\textbf u}} \|^2\right].
\end{eqnarray}

\paragraph{VS rheology assumptions} In summary:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Basal Friction} is based on a constant coefficient, similarly to the MC rheology.

\item \textit{Internal Friction} is neglected.

\item \textit{Earth pressure coefficient} is equal to one.

\item Additional \textit{turbulent friction} is based on the local velocity by a quadratic expression.

\item Velocity based \textit{curvature effects} are included into the equations, following an alternative formulation.
\end{itemize}

\section{UQ Process}
The key to a good forecasting capability in the context of mass flows requires the careful selection of the pair $\left(M(A), P_{M(A)}\right)$, where $A$ is a set of assumptions, $M(A)$ is the model which combines those assumptions, and $P_M$ is a probability distribution in the parameter space of $M$. For the sake of simplicity we are always taking $P_M$ uniformly distributed on selected parameter ranges.

\paragraph{Models and assumptions} An assumption is a quite general concept - for example it can be a specific equation for the internal stress, the implementation of bed curvature effects, of active-passive material stretching, or the use of a specific correction on the pressure effects. Assumptions are what makes the models being different, and each model may be seen as the combined result of a set of assumptions. Sometimes a good model contains a useless assumption that may be removed, sometimes a good assumption should be implemented inside a different model - those are usually considered as subjective choices, not data driven. Moreover, the correct assumptions may change through time, making the analysis more difficult. We provided a list of assumptions behind SWE general implementation, and behind each rheology in section \ref{sec:GeoPhFlows}.

\paragraph{Parameters ranges} It is worth mentioning that whereas the support of $P_M$ can be restricted to a single point in case an inverse problem is solved for the optimal reconstruction of a particular flow, this is not possible if we are interested in the general predictive capabilities of the model, i.e. the target of probabilistic hazard assessment. In this study we always assume $P_M\sim \bigotimes_{i=1}^{N_M} Unif(a_{i,M},b_{i,M})$, where $N_M$ is the number of parameters of $M$. These parameter ranges will not be selected under the influence of a particular observation, but we will try to use the information gathered in literature about the physical meaning of those values, together with a preliminary testing, coupling the range of possible runouts. This coupling step is detailed in section \ref{consistency}, and required to focus the statistical comparison on a consistence range of flow regimes.

\paragraph{Simulated quantities} The simulation algorithms can be schematized as:
$$\textmd{(1)INPUT VARIABLES} \rightarrow \textmd{(2)HIDDEN DYNAMIC QUANTITIES} \rightarrow \textmd{(3)OBSERVABLE OUTPUTS}$$
The \emph{input variables} are the parameters of $M$, i.e. volume, rheology coefficients, but can include also the initiation site and geometry, and the digital elevation map. The \emph{hidden quantities} include the stress terms in the Newton Equations that rule the simulation, and their powers. Those are hidden to the observation in a real flow, but they directly depend on the parameters, and represent a fundamental link between the parameters and the observable outputs. Moreover, the models share some of those terms while change others, and this enables a detailed comparison of the real physics below the curtain (see Sections \ref{Hq1},\ref{Hq2}). Finally, the \emph{observable outputs} include what can be measured in space and time: e.g. flow height, lateral extent, area, velocity, acceleration, and combined quantities as $Fr$ (see Sections \ref{Obs1}, \ref{Obs2}). In the sequel (2) and (3) are also called quantities of interest (QoI).

\paragraph{Local samples and spatial averaging}
The QoI in the previous scheme which are evolving fields $f(\underline{\textbf x},t)$ in space-time, can be either \emph{locally sampled} or \emph{spatially averaged} (see sections \ref{sec:QoIs}, \ref{QoI2}). The spatial averaging is defined by $F(t)=\int_{\mathbb R^k}f(\underline{\textbf x},t) d\underline{\textbf x}$. In the most of the cases $k=2$, and $d\underline{\textbf x}$ is given by the area of the mesh elements. Sometimes $k=3$, e.g. concerning speed, and $d\underline{\textbf x}$ is the element of volume corresponding to the mesh elements.

A fundamental part of this research was made possible by the new implementation of a local sampling option in the TITAN2D cyber-infrastructure. In particular, once a set of sample points $(x_i)_{i=1,...,N}$ is chosen, each field $f(\underline{\textbf x},t)$ is calculated as a function of time on the elements of the numerical mesh which are found to contain the $(x_i)_{i=1,...,N}$. Exploring differences in time and location enable to constrain the changes in flow regime. Those are really important because if the flow behavior is radically different, then the significance and effects of the assumptions may also change.

\paragraph{Monte Carlo simulation} In general, for each QoI, during a Monte Carlo simulation we sample the input variables and obtain a family of temporal graphs on time domains depending on the flow duration. These results are statistically summarized - plotting their expectation, and their 5$^{\mathrm{th}}$ and 95$^{\mathrm{th}}$ percentiles. In the following, we will detail the considered input variables and quantities of interest for each of our cases study.

Our sampling technique of the input variables is based on the Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) idea, and in particular, on the improved space-filling properties of the orthogonal array-based Latin Hypercubes (see Appendix \ref{Appendix}). The LHS is performed over $[0,1]^3$ for the MC and VS input parameters, and $[0,1]^4$ for PF input parameters (see Section \ref{consistency}). Those adimensional samples are homothetically transformed to fill the required intervals.

\subsection{Statistical analysis of force contributions}\label{statF}
A statistical analysis capable of measuring the contributions of different force components in the rheology models is presented. That is helpful to explore and compare the effects of the assumptions behind some modeling choices, onto the time evolution of the flowing material. Let $(F_i(x,t))_{i=1,\dots, 6}$ be the array of force components, where $x\in\mathbb R^2$ is a spatial location, and $t\in T$ is a time instant.

In our case study, $(F_1,F_2):=($\textbf{LHS}$_1,$\textbf{LHS}$_2)$, i.e. the left-hand side terms in the momentum equation, while $(F_3,\dots,F_6):=($\textbf{RHS}$_1,\dots,$\textbf{RHS}$_4)$ are the right-hand side terms. These forces can take different formulations in the different models, which are detailed in section \ref{sec:Fterms}. This type of procedure can be applied to any additive decomposition of the physical forces. The analysis of $RHS$ can inform on local effects, while $LHS$ concerns the of un-local dynamics in space and time.

In general we show the projection of the forces on the slope direction, or the product with the velocity field, i.e. the power related to them. Hence, in the following the forces are scalar and not vectorial terms. It is important to remark that all the forces are hidden dynamic quantities (see above), depending on the input variables, and they are thus considered as random variables. The degree of contribution of those force terms is significantly variable in space and time, and we define the \emph{contribution coefficients} to model this. The definitions are not depending on the location, but all the results will significantly depend of that choice. Next notation will assume to be in a selected location $x=L_k$, where $k\ge 1$. In the following we will focus on \textbf{RHS} forces, although some testing including \textbf{LHS} forces has also been accomplished.

\begin{definition}[Contribution coefficients]
Let $(F_i)_{i\in I}$ be random variables on $(\Omega, \mathcal F, P)$, representing the considered force components in location $x$ at time $t$. Then, for each component $i$, the contribution coefficient is defined as:
$$C_i:=\mathbb E\left[\frac{F_i}{\Phi}\right],$$
where $\Phi$ is a dominating function, i.e. $\Phi\ge |F_i|$, $\forall i\in I$.
\end{definition}
The \emph{total force}, i.e $\sum_i F_i$ excluding the inertial terms, is not a good candidate for a dominating function. Indeed, the terms often have opposite signs, and their sum can be really small. Another issue is given by the existence of a subset of times $\Theta$ characterized by the absence of flow in the selected location $x$. In $\Theta$ the dominant force is null, and cannot be the denominator of a fraction.

We have tested two alternative $\Phi$ choices: $\Phi_1$ is based on the $l^1$ norm, and defined as:
$$\Phi_1:=\left\{
    \begin{array}{ll}
      \sum_i \frac{|F_i|}{2}, & \hbox{if not null;} \\
      1, & \hbox{otherwise.}
    \end{array}
  \right.$$
In contrast $\Phi_2$ is a dominant force based on the $l^\infty$ norm:
$$\Phi_2:=\left\{
    \begin{array}{ll}
      \max_i |F_i|, & \hbox{if not null;} \\
      1, & \hbox{otherwise.}
    \end{array}
  \right.$$
In particular, for a particular location $x$, time $t$, and parameter sample $\omega$, we have $C_i=0$ if there is no flow or all the forces are null. The expectation of $C_i$ is reduced by the chance of $F_i$ being small compared to the other terms, or by the chance of having no flow in $(x,t)$. Moreover, $\mathbb E[C_i]\in[-1,1]$, $\forall i$.
\begin{proposition}
Let $\Phi_k$, $k=1,2$ be the functions described above. Then they are well defined dominating function, i.e. $\Phi_k\ge |F_j|$, $\forall j,k$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
If $k=1$, the Newton equation states $\sum_{j\in J} F_j =\sum_{i\in I} F_i,$ where $(F_j)_{j\in J}$ are inertial forces, and $(F_i)_{i\in I}$ the local forces. Then, $\forall h\in I$
$$F_h=\sum_{i\neq h,\ i\in I} F_i - \sum_{j\in J} F_j.$$
And hence
$$|F_h|\le |F_h|+\sum_{i\neq k,\ i\in I} |F_i| - \sum_{j\in J} |F_j|=2\Phi_1.$$
A similar equation is valid $\forall k\in J$. If $k=2$, or if the inertial forces are not included, the proof is trivial.
\end{proof}

Furthermore, assuming $\Phi=\Phi_2$, there is a useful result explaining the meaning of those coefficients through the conditional expectation.
\begin{proposition}
Let $(F_i)_{i\in I}$ be random variables on $(\Omega, \mathcal F, P)$, representing the considered force components in location $x$ at time $t$. For each $i$, let $C_i$ be the contribution coefficient of force $F_i$, assuming $\Phi=\Phi_2$. Then we have the following expression:
$$C_i=\sum_j p_j \mathbb E\left[\frac{F_i}{|F_j|}\ \Big{|}\ \Phi=|F_j|\right],$$
where $p_j:=P\left\{\Phi=|F_j|\right\}$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Let $Z$ be a discrete random variable such that, for each $j\in\mathbb N$, $(Z=j) \Longleftrightarrow (\Phi=|F_j|)$. Then, by the rule of chain expectation:
$$C_i=\mathbb E\left[\frac{F_i}{\Phi}\right]=\mathbb E\left[\mathbb E\left[\frac{F_i}{\Phi}\ \Big{|}\ Z=j\right]\right]=$$
$$=\mathbb E\left[\mathbb E\left[\frac{F_i}{|F_j|}\ \Big{|}\ Z=j\right]\right]=\sum_j P\left\{Z=j\right\} \mathbb E\left[\frac{F_i}{|F_j|}\ \Big{|}\ Z=j\right].$$
Moreover, by definition, $p_j=P\left\{Z=j\right\}$. This completes the proof.
\end{proof}

The last proposition brings to the definition of the \emph{dominance factors} $(p_j)_{j=1,\dots, k}$, i.e. the probability of each $F_j$ to be the dominant force in $(x,t)$.

\begin{definition}[Dominance factors and conditional contributions]
Let $(F_i)_{i=1,\dots, k}$ be random variables on $(\Omega, \mathcal F, P)$, representing arbitrary force components in location $x$ at time $t$. Then, for each pair of components $(i,j)$, the conditional contribution $C_{i,j}$ is defined as:
$$C_{i,j}:=\mathbb E\left[\frac{F_i}{|F_j|}\ \Big{|}\ \Phi=|F_j|\right],$$
where $\Phi=\Phi_2$ is the dominant force. In particular, for each component $i$, the dominance factor is defined as:
$$p_j:=P\left\{\Phi=|F_j|\right\}.$$
\end{definition}

In sections \ref{stat1} and \ref{stat2} we display the contribution coefficients as a function of time, assuming $\Phi=\Phi_2$. Moreover, we report the dominance factors plots, another very useful tool to read the dynamic significance of the forces as a function of time and location.

\subsection{Forces terms definition}\label{sec:Fterms}
Forces analyzed have been classified according to the terms of the momentum equation in (\ref{eq:D_A}). Moreover, the forces terms in $S_x$ have been additionally classified, accordingly to equations (\ref{S_terms_MC}), (\ref{eq:S_terms_PF}), (\ref{eq:S_terms_VS}), describing the three rheology models considered in this study. What follows is a summary of the force terms, and this notation will be used in the following (see Sections \ref{Hq1}, \ref{Hq2}).

\paragraph{Left-hand side, LHS forces}
\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{LHS_1} = \left[\frac{\partial}{\partial t} (h\bar{u}), \frac{\partial}{\partial t} (h\bar{v})\right],
\end{align}
it is the temporal derivative of momentum.

\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{LHS_2} = \left[\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(h\bar{u}^2 + \frac{1}{2}k g_{z}h^2\right) + \frac{\partial}{\partial y}(h\bar{u}\bar{v}),\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(h\bar{u}\bar{v}) +
\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(h\bar{v}^2 + \frac{1}{2}k g_{z}h^2\right)\right],
\end{align}
it is the material derivative of momentum, due to the advection.

\paragraph{Right-hand side, RHS forces}
\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{RHS_1} = [g_x h,g_y h],
\end{align}
it is the gravitational force term, it has the same formulation in all models.

The formula of basal friction force $\boldsymbol{RHS_2}$ depends on the model:
\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{RHS_2} = -h g_z\tan(\phi_{bed})\left[\frac{\bar{u}}{\| \underset{^\sim}{\bar{\textbf u}} \|}, \frac{\bar{v}}{\| \underset{^\sim}{\bar{\textbf u}} \|} \right],\textmd{ in MC model.}\nonumber\\
\boldsymbol{RHS_2} = - h g_z \ \mu_{b}(\|\underset{^\sim}{\bar{\textbf{u}}} \| , h)\left[\frac{\bar{u}}{\| \underset{^\sim}{\bar{\textbf{u}}} \|}, \frac{\bar{v}}{\| \underset{^\sim}{\bar{\textbf{u}}} \|}\right],\textmd{ in PF model.}\\
\boldsymbol{RHS_2} = -h g_{z} \mu\left[\frac{\bar{u}}{\| \underset{^\sim}{\bar{\textbf u}}\|} , \frac{\bar{v}}{\| \underset{^\sim}{\bar{\textbf u}}\|}\right],\textmd{ in VS model.}\nonumber
\end{align}

The formula of the force related to the topography curvature, $\boldsymbol{RHS_3}$, also depends on the model:
\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{RHS_3} = h \tan(\phi_{bed})\left[-\frac{\bar{u}^3}{r_x\| \underset{^\sim}{\bar{\textbf{u}}} \|}, -\frac{\bar{v}^3}{r_y\| \underset{^\sim}{\bar{\textbf{u}}} \|}\right],\textmd{ in MC model.}\nonumber\\
\boldsymbol{RHS_3} = h\ \mu_{b}(\|\underset{^\sim}{\bar{\textbf{u}}} \|,h)\left[-\frac{\bar{u}^3}{r_x\| \underset{^\sim}{\bar{\textbf{u}}} \|}, -\frac{\bar{v}^3}{r_y\| \underset{^\sim}{\bar{\textbf{u}}} \|}\right],\textmd{ in PF model.}\\
\boldsymbol{RHS_3} = h \mu\left[- \frac{\bar{u}\| \underset{^\sim}{\bar{\textbf u}} \|}{r_{x}} \mu,0\right],\textmd{ in VS model.}\nonumber
\end{align}

All the three models have an additional force term, having a different formula and meaning in the three models:
\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{RHS_4} =  - h k_{ap}\sin(\phi_{int})\left[ \ {\rm sgn}(\frac{\partial \bar{u}}{\partial y}) \frac{\partial (g_z h)}{\partial y},\ {\rm sgn}({\frac{\partial \bar{v}}{\partial x}}) \frac{\partial (g_z h)}{\partial x}\right],\textmd{ in MC model.}\nonumber\\
\boldsymbol{RHS_4} = g_{z}h\left[\frac{\partial h}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial h}{\partial y}\right],\textmd{ in PF model.}\\
\boldsymbol{RHS_4} = -\frac{\| \underset{^\sim}{\textbf g} \|}{\xi}\| \underset{^\sim}{\bar{\textbf u}} \|^2\left[\frac{\bar{u}}{\| \underset{^\sim}{\bar{\textbf u}}\|} \ ,\frac{\bar{v}}{\| \underset{^\sim}{\bar{\textbf u}}\|}\right],\textmd{ in VS model.}\nonumber
\end{align}

\newpage
\subsection{Definition and consistency of the input variables}\label{consistency}
In general, the three rheologies considered in this study, MC, PF, and VS, have totally different parameters. The statistical testing we perform requires to choose the parameter range $P_M$, and in principle it may be arbitrary. Nevertheless, if the total frictions of the models are not covering a similar span, the statistical comparison is dominated by trivial macroscopic differences, and cannot focus on the rheology details. Some degree of parameter consistency is required between the models.

We can find several instances of parameter choices in literature, and in general the choice depends on the case study. In all the models it is defined a basal friction stress (see $RHS_2$ in in \ref{sec:QoIs}). However, PF interpolates different effective friction angles, while VS includes a velocity based additional term. We tested that a direct correlation of effective friction angles is problematic to do. Hence, we did not follow such approach. In contrast, we make a preliminary testing on the extreme values of the parameter space, i.e. giving \emph{\textbf{max volume -- min resistance}}, and \emph{\textbf{min volume -- max resistance}}.

\paragraph{General definitions}
We assume what follows to simplify testing. Except when differently specified, parameters are sampled uniformly in linear scale.
\begin{itemize}
\item Material Volume $V$ is an additional input parameter in all the models, on the same range.

\item In MC, sampled input parameters are $\phi_{bed}$, and $\Delta \phi:=\phi_{int}-\phi_{bed}$. In particular, $\Delta \phi \in [2^{\mathrm{\circ}}, 10^{\mathrm{\circ}}]$ \citep{Dalbey2008}.

\item In PF, sampled input parameters are $\phi_1$, $\Delta \phi_{12}:=\phi_2-\phi_1$, and $\beta$. In particular, $\Delta \phi_{12} \in [10^{\mathrm{\circ}}, 15^{\mathrm{\circ}}]$, and $\beta \in [0.1, 0.85]$. Moreover, $\phi_3=\phi_1+1^\mathrm{\circ}$, and $\mathcal{L}$ is equal to 1 dm and 1 mm in the two case studies, respectively \citep{PouliquenForterre2002,ForterrePouliquen2003,Gray2014, Barker2015}.

\item In VS, sampled input parameters are $\mu$, and $\xi$. In detail, $\xi$ uniform sampling is accomplished in log-scale. In fact, values of $\xi$ between 250 and 4,000 $m/s^2$ have been described for snow avalanches \citep{Salm1993,Bartelt1999,Gruber2007}.
\end{itemize}
In summary, MC and VS have three-dimensional parameter spaces, while $PF$ a four-dimensional parameter space.

\paragraph{Flow down an inclined plane}
In this case study, \cite{Dalbey2008} assumed $\phi_{bed}=[15^\mathrm{\circ}, 30^\mathrm{\circ}]$, while \cite{WebbBursik2016} performed a series of laboratory experiments and found $\phi_{bed}=[18.2^\mathrm{\circ}, 34.4^\mathrm{\circ}]$. We relied on those published parameter choices to decide a comprehensive parameter range. Figure \ref{fig:Ramp-MaxMinRunouts} displays the maps of max flow height and max velocities observed in the extreme cases tested. Simulation options are - max\_time = 2 s, height/radius = 1.34, length\_scale = 1 m, number\_of\_cells\_across\_axis = 10, order = first, geoflow\_tiny = 1e4 \citep{Patra2005,Aghakhani2016}. Initial pile geometry is cylindrical.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Material Volume:} $[449.0 \ ,\ 607.0] \ cm^3$, i.e. average of $528.0 \ cm^3$ and uncertainty of $\pm15\%$.
\item \textbf{Rheology models' parameter space:}

The parameter ranges adopted in this case study are:

\vskip.3cm\noindent \textbf{MC} - $\phi_{bed} \in [18^{\mathrm{\circ}}, 30^{\mathrm{\circ}}]$.

\vskip.3cm\noindent \textbf{PF} - $\phi_1 \in [10^{\mathrm{\circ}}, 22^{\mathrm{\circ}}]$.

\vskip.3cm\noindent \textbf{VS} - $\mu \in [0.22, 0.45]$, $\quad \log(\xi) \in [3, 4]$.
\end{itemize}

Even if maximum and mininum runout are both matching, the shape and lateral extent of the flow is remarkably different in the max. runout case, according to the three models. In particular, MC model can produce the largest lateral extent, and VS model displays an accentuated wedge-like shape, due to the increased friction in the lateral margins. These features will be detailed in Section \ref{Obs1}.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Volc{\'a}n de Colima block and ash flow}
In this case study, \cite{Dalbey2008} assumed $\phi_{bed}=[15^\mathrm{\circ}, 35^\mathrm{\circ}]$, while \citep{Capra2011} adopted $\phi_{bed}=30^\mathrm{\circ}$ in the simulation of a BAF in that same setting. Moreover, \cite{Spiller2014,Bayarri2015,Ogburn2016} found a statistical correlation between flow size and effective basal friction inferred from field observation of geophysical flows. The size of the BAF of this study would have $\phi_{bed}=[13^\mathrm{\circ}, 18^\mathrm{\circ}]$ according to their estimates. Figure \ref{Colima-MaxMinExtents} displays the maps of max flow height and max velocities observed in the extreme cases tested. Simulation options are - max\_time = 7200 s (2 hours), height/radius = 0.55, length\_scale = 4e3 m, number\_of\_cells\_across\_axis = 50, order = first, geoflow\_tiny = 1e4 \citep{Patra2005,Aghakhani2016}. Initial pile geometry is cylindrical.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Material Volume:} $[2.08, 3.12] \times 10^5 \ m^3$, i.e. average of $2.6  \times 10^5 \ m^3$ and uncertainty of $\pm 20\%$.
\item \textbf{Rheology models' parameter space:}

The parameter ranges adopted in this case study are:

\vskip.3cm\noindent \textbf{MC} - $\phi_{bed} \in [10^{\mathrm{\circ}}, 25^{\mathrm{\circ}}]$.

\vskip.3cm\noindent \textbf{PF} - $\phi_1 \in [8^{\mathrm{\circ}}, 18^{\mathrm{\circ}}]$.

\vskip.3cm\noindent \textbf{VS} - $\mu \in [0.15, 0.45]$, $\quad \log(\xi) \in [1.7, 4]$.

\end{itemize}

The models possess different features, even if the maximum runuout after channelization in the ravines is matching. In particular, VS lateral spreading is significant lower and material reaches higher thickness, whereas PF model seems to stop more gradually than MC with a more complex inundated area boundary lines. These features will be detailed in Section \ref{Obs2}.

\section{QoIs and Data Collected - Flow down and inclined plane, and a change in slope to a flat plane}\label{sec:QoIs}
First case study is the small scale experimental setting described above. First we describe the observable outputs (Section \ref{Obs1}), and then the hidden dynamic quantities (Section \ref{Hq1}). In many plots we note the effect of cutting the flow when height is $<1$ mm, which is at the scale of the smallest granular size.

\subsection{Observable outputs} \label{Obs1}
Observable outputs include the flow height, speed, $Fr$, and acceleration as a function of time, measure on the four location $L_1,\dots, L_4$ displayed in Fig. \ref{fig:Ramp-first}. In addition, max lateral extension, flow area, and spatially averaged speed and $Fr$ are displayed. UQ is also performed, accordingly to the parameter ranges described in Section \ref{consistency}.

Different rheology models are displayed with different colors. Plots are at different scale, for simplifying lecture.}
        \label{fig:Ramp-H}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Flow Height, local measurements}
Figure \ref{fig:Ramp-H} shows the flow height, $h(L,t)$, at the points $(L_i)_{i=1,\dots,4}$, for the three rheology models. In plot \ref{fig:Ramp-H}a, related to point $L_1$ placed on the initial pile, the initial values of $\sim 6$ cm are the equal and only represent the pile height uncertainty, but then the flow height decreases slightly faster for the PF model, and slower for the MC, compared to the VS. Difference are more significant in plot \ref{fig:Ramp-H}b, related to point $L_2$, placed in the middle of the slope. Flow max height is greater for the VS, and smaller for the PF model, which decreases slower after the height peak. However, the value is $\sim$15 times smaller than initial pile height, of $\sim 4$ mm. None of the models leaves a material deposit in $L_1$ or $L_2$, i.e. the 95$^{\mathrm{th}}$ percentile of the height is null at the ending-time. In contrast, a deposit is left at points $L_3$, i.e. plot \ref{fig:Ramp-H}c placed at the change in slope, and $L_4$, , i.e. plot \ref{fig:Ramp-H}d in the middle of the flat runout. MC's deposit is higher than the other models' at $L_3$, while it is not significantly different at $L_4$ between the three models. It is of $\sim 3$ mm in average, but can range from $0$ to $8$ mm. In plots \ref{fig:Ramp-H}b and \ref{fig:Ramp-H}c the elimination of material when height is $<1$ mm, cuts the 95$^{\mathrm{th}}$ percentile to zero when its value is below that threshold.
\begin{figure}[H]
         \centering
        \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{InclinedPlane/LocalMeasurments/Velocity_Inc.png}
        \caption{Records of flow speed at four spatial locations of interest. Bold line is mean value, dashed/dotted lines are 5$^{\mathrm{th}}$ and 95$^{\mathrm{th}}$ percentile bounds. Different rheology models are displayed with different colors. Plots are at different scale.}
        \label{fig:Ramp-Vel}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Flow Speed, local measurements}
Figure \ref{fig:Ramp-Vel} shows the flow speed, $\Vert \underline{\mathbf{u}} \Vert(L,t)$, at the points $(L_i)_{i=1,\dots,4}$, for the three rheology models. In plots \ref{fig:Ramp-Vel}a and \ref{fig:Ramp-Vel}b, related to points $L_1$ and $L_2$, speed peaks are similar between the models, at $\sim 1$ m/s and $\sim 0.6$ cm/s, respectively. In plot \ref{fig:Ramp-Vel}a VS peak is higher, but then its speed decreases more linearly, while MC and PF have a more concave profile, making MC the faster model after $0.3$ sec. In plot \ref{fig:Ramp-Vel}b it is the PF model to decrease more linearly. UQ shows that MC model uncertainty is remarkably larger than in the other models, and produces higher values in the 95$^{\mathrm{th}}$ percentile plots. Lowest speed values are affected by the elimination of material below $1$ mm flow height threshold. In plots \ref{fig:Ramp-Vel}c and \ref{fig:Ramp-Vel}d, related to points $L_3$ and $L_4$, the PF velocity profile is significantly lower than the other models, but it also decreases slower, and matches with the stopping times of them. Speed in the deposits is below $0.1$ m/s in $L_3$, negligible in $L_4$.

\subsubsection{Froude Number, local measurements}
Figure \ref{fig:Ramp-Fr} shows the Froude Number, $\Vert \underline{\mathbf{u}} \Vert/\sqrt{gh}$, at the points $(L_i)_{i=1,\dots,4}$, for the three rheology models.
\begin{figure}[H]
         \centering
        \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{InclinedPlane/LocalMeasurments/Froude.png}
        \caption{Records of Froude number at four spatial locations of interest. Bold line is mean value, dashed/dotted lines are 5$^{\mathrm{th}}$ and 95$^{\mathrm{th}}$ percentile bounds. Different rheology models are displayed with different colors. Plots are at different scale.}
        \label{fig:Ramp-Fr}
\end{figure}
Froude Number combines the estimates of flow height and speed, described above. In plot \ref{fig:Ramp-Fr}a, related to point $L_1$, $Fr$ maximum average value is smaller for the MC model, $\sim 4$, than for the others, $\sim 6$. However, UQ tells us that 95$^{\mathrm{th}}$ percentile almost reaches $\sim 10$ in all the three models. After the peak, the values decrease slower and more concavely in MC model than in the others. In plot \ref{fig:Ramp-Fr}b, related to point $L_2$, $Fr$ shows a bimodal profile in time, with two separate peaks at $\sim 10$ on average, but reaching $\sim 18$ in the 95$^{\mathrm{th}}$ percentile plot. In fact, first maximum, at $\sim 0.25$ s is due to the speed peak, and second, at $\sim 0.6$ s is related to $\sqrt{h}$ decreasing while the speed is not significantly changing. In plot \ref{fig:Ramp-Fr}c and \ref{fig:Ramp-Fr}d, related to points $L_3$ and $L_4$, bimodality is less accentuated and becomes a plateau profile in $\sim [0.5, 0.75]$ sec. PF model gives significantly larger $Fr$ values, even $>20$ at $L_3$, due to a larger speed and a thinner flow. It is worth noting, for the sake of PF model, that $Fr>\beta$ and the flow is in the dynamic regime during the most of the time.

\subsubsection{Flow Acceleration, local measurements}
Figure \ref{fig:Ramp-AccL} shows the flow speed, $\Vert \underline{\mathbf{a}} \Vert(L,t)$, at the points $(L_i)_{i=1,\dots,4}$, for the three rheology models.
\begin{figure}[H]
         \centering
        \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{InclinedPlane/LocalMeasurments/Acceleration.png}
        \caption{Records of flow acceleration magnitude (computed from LHS). Bold line is mean value, dashed lines are 5$^{\mathrm{th}}$ and 95$^{\mathrm{th}}$ percentile bounds. Different rheology models are displayed with different colors. Plots are at different scale.}
        \label{fig:Ramp-AccL}
\end{figure}
Acceleration is the link between force terms and observable motion. We calculated it from the LHS of the dynamical equation, but using the RHS terms produces very similar results, although not identical due to the numerical approximations in our solution. In plot \ref{fig:Ramp-AccL}a, related to point $L_1$, MC and VS show a plateau before $\sim 0.4$ sec, at $\sim 2.5 \ m/s^2$ and $\sim 3.5 \ m/s^2$, respectively, while PF linearly decreases between those same values. In plot \ref{fig:Ramp-AccL}b, related to point $L_2$, are MC and PF to show a plateau, at $\sim 2.2$ m/s$^2$, while VS has a more bell-shaped profile. UQ tells us that PF has a smaller uncertainty than the other models. In plot \ref{fig:Ramp-AccL}c, related to point $L_3$, all the models show a bimodal profile, with peaks at $\sim$ 0.5 sec and 0.8 sec. This is more accentuated for MC and VS, whereas the second peak is almost absent from PF profile. The second peak is motivated by an increase of velocity in the down-slope direction after its reduction due to lateral spreading of material. At the first peak, acceleration values are significant, with average peaks of MC and PF both at $\sim 15 \ m/s^2$, and 95$^{\mathrm{th}}$ percentile plot reaching $\sim 50 \ m/s^2$ and $\sim 55 \ m/s^2$, respectively. VS shows about halved acceleration peak values. At the second peak, average acceleration values are similar for MC and VS, at $\sim 5 \ m/s^2$. In contrast, 95$^{\mathrm{th}}$ percentile plot is $> 50 \ m/s^2$ for MC, while $\sim 30 \ m/s^2$ for VS. In plot \ref{fig:Ramp-AccL}d, related to point $L_4$, the acceleration has a first peak at $\sim 4 \ m/s^2$, and a final asymptote at $\sim 2 \ m/s^2$ for MC and VS, $\sim 1 \ m/s^2$ for PF. These values generally mean flow deceleration, and uncertainty is more relevant for MC and PF than for VS.
\begin{figure}[H]

        \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{InclinedPlane/AveragedMeasurments/Averaged_MeasuresIncline.png}
        \caption{Comparison between spatial averages of $(a)$ flow speed, and $(b)$ Froude Number in addition to the flow $(c)$ lateral extent, and $(d)$ inundated area, as a function of time.}
        \label{fig:Ramp-spatial}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Flow extents and averaged measurements}
Figure \ref{fig:Ramp-spatial} shows the spatial average of speed and Froude Number, for the three rheology models. Moreover, it shows the (maximum) lateral extent and inundated area of flow, as a function of time. Spatial averages and global quantities as maximum lateral extent and inundated area have smoother plots than local measurements. Most of the details observed in local measurements are not easy to discern. In plot \ref{fig:Ramp-spatial}a the speed shows a bell-shaped profile in all the models, with an average peak at $\sim 1.4 m/s$ and uncertainty range, given by 5$^{\mathrm{th}}$ and 95$^{\mathrm{th}}$ percentiles, of $\pm 0.4 m/s$ for PF and VS. VS is slightly slower, reaching $\sim 1.3 m/s$ in the average. MC shows a larger uncertainty range, of $\pm 0.6 m/s$. The maximum speed is reached first by VS and PF at $\sim 0.55 s$, and last by MC at $\sim 0.65 s$. In plot \ref{fig:Ramp-spatial}b, also Froude Numbers have a bell-shaped profile. Fr peaks are temporally aligned with speed peaks, and are $\sim 10$ in VS, $\sim 11$ in MC, $\sim 13.5$ in PF, on average. Uncertainty range is about $\pm 4$ in all models. In plot \ref{fig:Ramp-spatial}c inundated area shows similar max values in PF and VS, at $\sim 0.6 m^2$ on average, and uncertainty of $\pm 0.15 m^2$. MC is lower, at $\sim 0.45 m^2$ on average, and less uncertain, $\pm 0.10 m^2$. VS does not decrease significantly after reaching the peak, whereas the other models contract their area, to approximately half of the maximum extent. In plot \ref{fig:Ramp-spatial}d the lateral extent starts equal to the pile diameter $15 cm$, and then rises in two stages in MC and PF, the second and greater rise starting at $\sim 0.6 s$, corresponding to the time of arrival at the change in slope $L_3$ (see Fig. \ref{fig:Ramp-H}c). VS rises without showing two phases. After the first phase, average lateral extent is at $\sim 50 cm$ in PF and VS, while it is $\sim 43 cm$ in MC. Uncertainty range is $\pm 7 cm$ for all models at that time. Final extent is $\sim 75 cm$ in PF, $\sim 65 cm$ in MC, $\sim 55 cm$ in VS. Uncertainty range is $\pm 5 cm$ in VS, but rises to $\pm 10 cm$ in MC and PF.

\subsection{Statistical analysis of dynamic quantities}\label{Hq1}
We focus on the force terms and related powers, as well as their statistical analysis. The classification follows the definitions in section \ref{sec:Fterms}. In particular, all the estimates assume a material density of the flow $\rho = 805 kg/m^3$. This a fixed scaling factor, and the plots aspect is not affected by its value.

\subsubsection{Forces, spatial integral}
Figure \ref{fig:Ramp-Fx-spatial} shows the spatial sum of the force terms in the slope direction, for the three rheology models. Force sum is performed on half spatial domain, due to the symmetry with respect to the flow central axis. In plot \ref{fig:Ramp-Fx-spatial}a $\boldsymbol{RHS_1}$ represents the effect of the gravity in all the models. It starts with a plateau at $\sim 1.3 N$ before $\sim 0.55 s$, then decreases to zero after the material crosses the change in slope. The force values are consistent with the expression $\rho \left(V/2\right) g_x$, representing half the weight of material, projected along the slope direction. Uncertainty range of $\pm 0.2 N$ on the peak values. MC decreases slower, and has a more significant uncertainty, after the change in slope. PF decreases faster. In plot \ref{fig:Ramp-Fx-spatial}b $\boldsymbol{RHS_2}$ represent the friction at the base of the flow. It is negative and opposed to the gravity. A similar profile is shared by the three models, with a first short-lasting weakening before $\sim 0.1 s$, a plateau with a small strengthening after $\sim 0.5 s$, and a final waning after $\sim 1 s$, at the conclusion of the dynamics. MC does not reach zero, while the other models do. VS values are generally $\sim 0.5 N$ weaker than MC, and PF is intermediate, except in the initial peak, where it is the weakest. Strongest forces are reached during the plateau, and are $\sim -0.55 N$, $\sim -0.75 N$, $\sim -0.9 N$, with uncertainty range of $\pm 0.25 N$ in the plateau. Uncertainty is reduced in the final stages of VS and PF, but increases in MC. In plot \ref{fig:Ramp-Fx-spatial}c $\boldsymbol{RHS_3}$ is related to the curvature effects, and is not null only at the change in slope. It is always negative, i.e. reducing flow velocity, indeed it is equivalent to the friction due to the additional weigh generated by centrifugal forces. Its scale is ten times smaller than the previous plots, with values above $0.1 N$ only in MC. VS displays a bimodal profile, with a second and weaker peak at $\sim 0.75 s$. In plot \ref{fig:Ramp-Fx-spatial}d $\boldsymbol{RHS_4}$ is related to the additional forces of the models, differently characterized. In MC and PF, they are significantly small forces before $0.1 s$, completely negligible later. In VS, this is the velocity dependent term. It is negative and plays a significant role. It reaches $\sim 1 N$ at the change in slope, with uncertainty $\pm 0.3 N$. It is bell shaped and null before $\sim 0.1 s$ and after $\sim 1 s$. In plot \ref{fig:Ramp-Fx-spatial}e $\sum^4_{i=1}\boldsymbol{RHS_i}$ represents the total force in the slope direction, and summarizes the previous plots. The profile is characterized by a positively valued stage at $\sim 0.5 N$ before the change in slope, and by a negatively valued stage after that, with bell-shaped profile, and a peak at $\sim -0.5 N$. In the first stage MC is more flat, while PF and VS decrease. In the second stage MC is occurring later in time, of $\sim 0.1 s$; PF and VS are remarkably similar, but VS wanes faster.

        \label{fig:Ramp-Fx-spatial}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Powers, spatial integral}
Figure \ref{fig:Ramp-Power-spatial} shows the spatial sum of the powers, for the three rheology models. Power sum is performed on half spatial domain, due to the symmetry with respect to the flow central axis. The plots follow the same order used in Fig. \ref{fig:Ramp-Fx-spatial}, but the scalar product with velocity imposes the bell-shaped profile observed in Fig. \ref{fig:Ramp-spatial}a. In plot \ref{fig:Ramp-Power-spatial}a the power of $\boldsymbol{RHS_1}$ starts from zero and rises up to $\sim 1.5 J$, with uncertainty of $\pm 0.5 J$. In plot \ref{fig:Ramp-Power-spatial}b the power of  $\boldsymbol{RHS_2}$ is negative and peaks to $\sim 1 W$ in MC and PF, $\sim 0.7 W$ in VS. The initial ripple observed in Fig. \ref{fig:Ramp-Fx-spatial}b is not observed, nor the plateau. In plot \ref{fig:Ramp-Power-spatial}c the power of $\boldsymbol{RHS_3}$ has a similar profile to the force it is weaker than $-0.1 W$ on average, although MC uncertainty reaches $\sim -0.25 W$. In plot \ref{fig:Ramp-Power-spatial}d the power of $\boldsymbol{RHS_4}$ is relevant only in VS, although also in PF has a very short lasting positive peak up to $0.3 W$ before to become null at $\sim 0.1 s$. Power in VS is  $\sim -0.7 W$, $\pm 0.3 J$. In plot \ref{fig:Ramp-Power-spatial}e the power of the total force $\sum^4_{i=1}\boldsymbol{RHS_i}$ summarizes the energy accumulation and dissipation, following a sinusoid profile. As observed in Fig. \ref{fig:Ramp-Fx-spatial}e, MC profile is delayed of $\sim 0.1 s$ compared to the others, and is affected by a larger uncertainty.

        \label{fig:Ramp-Power-spatial}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Force contribution coefficients, RHS terms}
Figure \ref{fig:Ramp-Ci_x} shows the Contributions Coefficients $(C_i)_{i=1,\dots,4}$, for the three rheology models and focusing on the RHS terms in the slope direction. Force contributions are defined in section \ref{statF} and are obtained dividing the force terms described in section \ref{sec:Fterms} by a dominant function $\Phi$. This is a tool to compare the different force terms, scaling the plots by the dominant function $\Phi$ - in this case in $[-1,1]$. It also represent the degree of relevance of the assumptions behind the force terms, changing as a function of time. The different models are plotted separately: \ref{fig:Ramp-Ci_x}a,d,g,j assume MC; \ref{fig:Ramp-Ci_x}b,e,h,k assume PF; \ref{fig:Ramp-Ci_x}c,f,i,l assume VS. The plots \ref{fig:Ramp-Ci_x}a,b,c are related to point $L_1$, placed on the initial pile. $C_1$ and $C_2$ play the major roles, with a minor contribution $C_4$ in VS. Contributions profiles are flat plateaus that start to wane after $0.4 s$, with the rise of the probability of no-flow at the point $L_1$ (see also Fig. \ref{fig:Ramp-Pr_x}. Uncertainty is related to the no-flow times, and to the value of $C_2$. The negative contribution $C_4$ can be significant, as it is shown by the 5$^{\mathrm{th}}$ percentile values, but appears after $0.25 s$. The plots \ref{fig:Ramp-Ci_x}d,e,f are related to point $L_2$, placed in the middle of the slope. Again the major contributions are $C_1$ and $C_2$, with trapezoidal profile preceded and followed by no-flow. In VS, $C_4$ becomes as a significant as $C_2$, but it is bimodal instead than trapezoidal. The plots \ref{fig:Ramp-Ci_x}g,h,i are related to point $L_3$, placed at the change in slope. The contributions $C_1$ and $C_2$ are still the largest, but their profiles are bell-shaped. In VS, $C_4$ is almost identical to $C_2$. In all the models, $C_3$ is also significant, with a peak similar to $C_2$, but has a different profiles - triangular for MC and PF, bimodal for VS. In MC the decrease occurs in two stages. The uncertainty tells us that $C_3$ can also be the dominant force, for a shorter time. Due to the presence of deposit, all the contributions are small (particularly small in PF), but not zero at the ending time. The plots \ref{fig:Ramp-Ci_x}j,k,l are related to point $L_4$, placed in the middle of the flat runout. Only $C_2$ has a major role, with a bell shaped profile faster to wax than to wane. Contribution $C_4$ has a minor role in VS and PF. Uncertainty affects this force, which can be shortly the dominant term, in PF.

\newpage
\subsubsection{Force dominance factors, RHS terms}\label{stat1}
Figure \ref{fig:Ramp-Pr_x} shows the Dominance Factors $(P_i)_{i=1,\dots,4}$, for the three rheology models and focusing on the RHS terms in the slope direction. The are defined in section \ref{statF} and are the probability of each force term (described in section \ref{sec:Fterms}) to be the maximal one. It is another tool to compare the different force terms, following a more strict approach than the Contribution Coefficients. The values are probability values, hence in $[0,1]$. The plots include also the probability of no-flow in the considered point. Similarly to Fig. \ref{fig:Ramp-Ci_x}, the different models are plotted separately: \ref{fig:Ramp-Pr_x}a,d,g,j assume MC; \ref{fig:Ramp-Pr_x}b,e,h,k assume PF; \ref{fig:Ramp-Pr_x}c,f,i,l assume VS. The plots \ref{fig:Ramp-Pr_x}a,b,c are related to point $L_1$, placed on the initial pile. Only $\boldsymbol{RHS_1}$ can be the dominant force, and no-flow probability is $(1-P_1)$. Same thing in the plots \ref{fig:Ramp-Pr_x}d,e,f are related to point $L_2$, placed in the middle of the slope. The plots \ref{fig:Ramp-Pr_x}g,h,i are related to point $L_3$, placed at the change in slope. As observed in Fig. \ref{fig:Ramp-Ci_x}, also $\boldsymbol{RHS_3}$ can be the dominant term for a short time, with a peak probability of $\sim 30\%$. The plots \ref{fig:Ramp-Pr_x}j,k,l are related to point $L_4$, placed in the middle of the flat runout. Only $\boldsymbol{RHS_2}$ can be the dominant term, except in PF where there is $\sim 10\%$ that $\boldsymbol{RHS_4}$ is the dominant term at then ending-time.

\section{QoIs and Data Collected - Volc{\'a}n de Colima BAF}\label{QoI2}
\subsection{Observable outputs overview - MC model}
In our second case study, the number of spatial locations is significantly higher than previously. In fact, we placed 51 points to span the entire inundated area, in search of different flow regimes, displayed in Fig. \ref{fig:Colima-first}. First we show the average flow height, speed, and $Fr$ in all the locations, then, based on that, we select six points which we find representative of interesting flow regimes. Figures \ref{fig:BAF-H-MC}, \ref{fig:BAF-V-MC}, \ref{fig:BAF-Fr-MC} assume MC model, while the flow height results related to PF and VS models are included in the Supporting Material.

\subsubsection{Average flow Height, local measurements.}
Figure \ref{fig:BAF-H-MC} shows the flow height, $h(L,t)$, at the 51 spatial locations of interest, according to MC.
\begin{figure}[H]
         \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.92\textwidth]{MC&VS_51/Height_MC2.png}
        \caption{MC model, records of average flow height, $h(L,t)$, in 51 spatial locations of interest (Fig. \ref{fig:Colima-first}).}
        \label{fig:BAF-H-MC}
\end{figure}
Different plots have different scales on either time and space axes. In plot \ref{fig:BAF-H-MC}a, the only location is set on the center of the initial pile, and the profile is similar to what observed in point $L_1$ of the inclined plane case study, in Fig.\ref{fig:Ramp-H}a. In particular, the height decreases from the initial value to zero, in about 15 s. In plots \ref{fig:BAF-H-MC}b,c,d,e, the locations are are set at less than $\sim 1$ km radius from the initial pile (projected distance, without considering slope). Their profiles are similar to point $L_2$ in Fig.\ref{fig:Ramp-H}b. The height profile is bell-shaped, starting from zero and then waning back to zero in $\sim 20$ s. All the dynamics occurs during the first minute. Plot (b) shows transitional features, and focuses on points at the boundary of the initial pile. In plots \ref{fig:BAF-H-MC}f,g,h,i,j, points are set where the slope reduces, and the flow can channelize and leave a deposit. Projected distance from the initial pile is $\sim 2-3$ km. The profiles are sometimes similar to $L_3$ of Fig.\ref{fig:Ramp-H}c, other times to $L_4$ of Fig.\ref{fig:Ramp-H}d, in a few cases showing intermediate aspects. In general is either observed an initial short-lasting bulge followed by a slow decrease lasting minutes and asymptotically tending to a positive height, or a steady increase of material height tending to a positive height. In both cases it is sometimes observed a bimodal profile in the first 5 minutes. Finally, plots \ref{fig:BAF-H-MC}k,l focus on three points set at about the runout distance of the flow, in the most important ravines, at $\sim 4-5$ km projected distance from the initial pile. Profiles are similar to what observed in point $L_4$ of Fig.\ref{fig:Ramp-H}d.

\subsubsection{Average flow Speed, local measurements.}
Figure \ref{fig:BAF-V-MC} shows the flow speed, $h(L,t)$, at the 51 spatial locations of interest, according to MC.
\begin{figure}[H]
         \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.92\textwidth]{MC&VS_51/Velocity_MC3.png}
        \caption{MC model, records of average flow speed, $\vert\underline{u}\vert(L,t)$, in 51 spatial locations of interest (Fig. \ref{fig:Colima-first}).}
        \label{fig:BAF-V-MC}
\end{figure}
Again the different plots have different scales on either time and space axes. The plot profiles are similar to what observed in figure \ref{fig:Ramp-Vel}, following the plot profile classification described above. Maximum speed of $\sim 200 m/s$ is observed in proximity of the initial pile, in plot \ref{fig:BAF-V-MC}b, and it is related to the initiation collapse dynamics. After 1 km runout (horizontal projection), in plot \ref{fig:BAF-V-MC}e, the max speed is ten times smaller, $\sim 20 m/s$. At about 2 km from the initiation, when entering the main ravines, speed is $\sim 10 m/s$, and becomes $\sim 5 m/s$ or less in the distal part of the ravines.  In detail, in plots  \ref{fig:BAF-V-MC}f,g,h,i,j, the speed often shows bimodal profiles, not observed in the inclined plane case study. Moreover, in plots \ref{fig:BAF-V-MC}h,i,j, positive asymptotes are sometimes observed, meaning a slowly and steadily moving material even minutes after the collapse.

\subsubsection{Average Froude Number, local measurements.}
Figure \ref{fig:BAF-Fr-MC} shows the Froude Number, $\Vert \underline{\mathbf{u}} \Vert/\sqrt{gh}$, at the 51 spatial locations of interest, according to MC.
\begin{figure}[H]
         \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.92\textwidth]{MC&VS_51/Froude_MC2.png}
        \caption{MC model, records of average Froude Number in 51 spatial locations of interest (Fig. \ref{fig:Colima-first}).}
        \label{fig:BAF-Fr-MC}
\end{figure}
Froude Number combines height and speed measurements, and plot profiles are similar to what observed in Figure \ref{fig:Ramp-Fr}. In particular, in plots \ref{fig:BAF-Fr-MC}b,c,d, strongly bimodal profile are observed due to the interplay between flow height and flow speed. In plots \ref{fig:BAF-Fr-MC}f,g,h,i,j, sharp changes are observed, and the plots are significantly rough when the speed is significantly small.

\subsection{Observable outputs - six selected locations}\label{Obs2}
The six selected locations are $[L_8, L_{10}, L_{17}, L_{39}, L_{43}, L_{46}]$, (see Fig. \ref{fig:Colima-first}). First two points, $L_8$ and $L_{10}$ are both significantly close to the initiation pile, the points $L_{17}$ and $L_{43}$ are placed where the slope is reducing and the ravine channels start, and $L_{39}$ and $L_{46}$ are placed in the channels, further down-slope. Moreover, $L_8$, $L_{43}$, and $L_{46}$ are placed at the western side of the inundated area, whereas $L_{10}$, $L_{17}$, and $L_{39}$ are placed at the eastern side.

\subsubsection{Flow Height, selected measurements}
Figure \ref{fig:Colima-H} shows the flow height, $h(L,t)$, at the points $(L_i)_{i=8,10,17,39,43,46}$, for the three rheology models.
\begin{figure}[H]
         \centering
        \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{BAF_VolcanDeColima/LocalMeasurments/Height.png}
        \caption{Records of flow height at six selected locations. Bold line is mean value, dashed/dotted lines are 5$^{\mathrm{th}}$ and 95$^{\mathrm{th}}$ percentile bounds. Different rheology models are displayed with different colors. Plots are at different scale, for simplifying lecture.}
        \label{fig:Colima-H}
\end{figure}
In plots \ref{fig:Colima-H}a,b, we show the flow height in points $L_8$ and $L_{10}$, $\sim 200 m$ and $\sim 500 m$ from the initial pile, respectively. $L_8$ is on the east side, and $L_{10}$ on the west side of the flow. Models MC and PF have similar profiles, lasting less $\sim 15 s$ and bell-shaped. VS requires a significantly longer time to decrease, particularly in point $L_{10}$, where the average flow height is still positive after $\sim 200 s$. Peak average values in $L_8$ are $3.4 m$ for $PF$, $4.3 m$ for MC, $4.7 m$ for VS, with uncertainty of $\sim \pm 2 m$, halved on the lower side for $MC$, and $PF$. In $L_{10}$, models MC and PF are almost indistinguishable, with peak height at $1.4 m$ and uncertainty $\pm 0.5 m$. Model VS, in contrast, has a maximum height of $1.1 m$ lasting for $50s$, and 95$^{th}$ percentile reaching $3.7 m$. In plots \ref{fig:Colima-H}c,e, we show the flow height in points $L_{17}$ and $L_{43}$, both at $\sim 2 km$ from the initial pile, on the west and east side of the flow, respectively. All the three models show in both the points a fast spike in the first minute, followed by a slow decrease, still showing a positive average height after 30 m. Again, VS is significantly different from MC and PF, and has a secondary rise peaking at $\sim 450 s$, which is not observed in the other models. This produces higher values for the most of the temporal duration, but converges to similar deposit thickness after more than 1 hour. Maximum values are $1 m$ for MC, $2 m$ for PF, and $1.5 m$ for VS, in both locations. The 5$^{th}$ percentile is zero for all the three models, meaning that the parameter range does not always allow the flow to reach those locations. The 95$^{th}$ percentile is above $5m$ for the models, except in VS, point $L_{17}$. In plots \ref{fig:Colima-H}d,f, we show the flow height in points $L_{39}$ and $L_{46}$, both at more than $3 km$ from the initial pile, on the west and east side of the flow, respectively. The three models all show an increasing profile, except for MC in point $L_{39}$ which has an initial spike and a decrease before to rise again. A similar decreasing profile can be also observed in the 95$^{th}$ percentiles of all the models. It is significant that the 5$^{th}$ percentile of PF becomes positive after $\sim 5400 s$, meaning that the flows almost surely have reached that location. Deposit thickness is $\sim 0.5 m$ for all the models in point $L_{39}$, and $1.7 m$ for VS, $1.6 m$ for PF, $1.2 m$ for MC, in $L_{46}$.

\subsubsection{Flow Speed, selected measurements}
Figure \ref{fig:Colima-Vel} shows the flow speed, $\Vert \underline{\mathbf{u}} \Vert(L,t)$, at the points $(L_i)_{i=8,10,17,39,43,46}$, for the three rheology models. Like observed in Fig.\ref{fig:Colima-H}, pair of points $L_8$ and $L_{10}$, points $L_{17}$ and $L_{43}$, and points $L_{39}$ and $L_{46}$ have significantly similar plot profiles. In plot \ref{fig:Colima-Vel}a MC shows higher average speed, $\sim 80 m/s$, than PF and VS, both $\sim 70 m/s$. 95$^{th}$ percentile values can reach $150 m/s$ in MC, $140 m/s$ in VS, $130 m/s$ in PF. MC and PF are null after $20 s$, while VS decreases slower, and becomes null at $\sim 60 s$. In plot \ref{fig:Colima-Vel}b, the average peak values are $\sim 40 m/s$ in MC and PF, while only $20 m/s$ in VS. All the three models show 95$^{th}$ percentile values above $60 m/s$. VS speed decreases remarkably slower than in the other models, requiring more than $120 s$ to become null, while MC and PF speed remains positive for $\sim 25 s$. In plot \ref{fig:Colima-Vel}c, average speed is $\sim 20 m/s$ in PF, $\sim 10 m/s$ in MC, $\sim 2 m/s$ in VS. 95$^{th}$ percentile values can reach $\sim 55 m/s$ in PF, $\sim 48 m/s$ in MC, $\sim 24 m/s$ in VS. The duration of positive velocity in VS can be long hundredths of seconds. A very similar situation is pictured in plot \ref{fig:Colima-Vel}e. Instead in plot \ref{fig:Colima-Vel}d, only MC shows a max speed above $3 m/s$, the 95$^{th}$ percentile values at $\sim 15 m/s$. In the other models the average speed is always below $1 m/s$ and the 95$^{th}$ percentile values have an increasing profile followed by a slightly decreasing plateau, at $\sim 2 m/s$ in VS, $\sim 1 m/s$ in PF. VS can have a speed above $\sim 1 m/s$ at $\sim 3600 s$. In plot \ref{fig:Colima-Vel}f, only MC shows an average speed above zero, while in the other models even the 95$^{th}$ percentile values are always below $\sim 0.5 m/s$, and start to be positive only at $\sim 200 s$ in PF, and $\sim 600 s$ in VS. MC can have speed at $\sim 1 m/s$ for more than $\sim 500 s$, but the plot is very noisy.
\begin{figure}[H]

        \label{fig:Colima-Vel}
\end{figure}
\newpage
\subsubsection{Froude Number, selected measurements}
Figure \ref{fig:Colima-Fr1} shows the Froude Number, $\Vert \underline{\mathbf{u}} \Vert/\sqrt{gh}$, at the points $(L_i)_{i=8,10,17,39,43,46}$, for the three rheology models. 
\begin{figure}[H]
         \centering
        \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{BAF_VolcanDeColima/LocalMeasurments/Froude12.png}
        \caption{Records of Froude number at six selected locations. Records of points $L_{39}$, $L_{43}$, and $L_{46}$ are displayed at two different scales, according to the initial dynamics, in plots (d-f), and the asymptotic dynamics, in plots (g-i). Bold line is mean value, dashed/dotted lines are 5$^{\mathrm{th}}$ and 95$^{\mathrm{th}}$ percentile bounds. Different rheology models are displayed with different colors.}
        \label{fig:Colima-Fr1}
\end{figure}
Froude Number is proportional on the ratio between the flow speed and the square root of flow height, and hence the observed plots profiles are the combine effects of Fig.\ref{fig:Colima-H}  and \ref{fig:Colima-Vel}. Largest values are observed when the speed is significantly high compared to the flow height. Similarly to what observed in Fig. \ref{fig:Ramp-Fr} and \ref{fig:BAF-Fr-MC}, in plots \ref{fig:Colima-Fr1}a,b bimodal profiles are displayed. The first peak when the flow arrives in the location, the second when it leaves the location. Due to the slower dynamics of VS, the bimodal profile is almost absent. In PF the peaks, at $\sim 15$ and $\sim 30$, respectively, are slightly more prominent than in MC. In contrast, in plot \ref{fig:Colima-Fr1}c, MC displays an average Fr of $\sim 15$ significantly larger than in PF, $\sim 5$, and VS is almost null. In plot \ref{fig:Colima-Fr1}e the profile is significantly similar, but with lower values. In plots \ref{fig:Colima-Fr1}d,f, only MC displays a significantly positive Fr, the average below $5$, but the 95$^{th}$ percentile can reach above $20$. Finally, in plots \ref{fig:Colima-Fr1}g,h,i, a zoom on the low Fr values in the distal locations is displayed on a long time window. Observations are sometimes noisy, and only \ref{fig:Colima-Fr1}g shows the 95$^{th}$ percentile above 1. The rest of the plots are significantly lower. In general, PF has a more decreasing and less noisy character than MC and VS, while the latter is the most noisy and also has a weakly increasing profile.

\subsubsection{Flow Acceleration, selected measurements}
Figure \ref{fig:Colima-Accel1} shows the flow speed, $\Vert \underline{\mathbf{a}} \Vert(L,t)$, at the points $(L_i)_{i=8,10,17,39,43,46}$, for the three rheology models.
\begin{figure}[H]
         \centering
        \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{BAF_VolcanDeColima/LocalMeasurments/Acceleration12.png}
        \caption{Records of flow acceleration magnitude (computed from LHS), in six selected locations. Records of points $L_{39}$, $L_{43}$, and $L_{46}$ are displayed at two different scales, according to the initial dynamics, in plots (d-f), and the asymptotic dynamics, in plots (g-i). Bold line is mean value, dashed lines are 5$^{\mathrm{th}}$ and 95$^{\mathrm{th}}$ percentile bounds. Different rheology models are displayed with different colors.}
        \label{fig:Colima-Accel1}
\end{figure}
In plot \ref{fig:Colima-Accel1}a,b, MC and PF display a higher maximum acceleration, both at $\sim 6 m/s^2$ and $\sim 2.5 m/s^2$ in the first and second plot respectively, than VS, $\sim 3.5 m/s^2$ and $\sim 0.5 m/s^2$, respectively. The latter has a slower decrease to zero, consistent with what observed on the speed and Froude. Uncertainty in VS is more significant in plot \ref{fig:Colima-Accel1}a, than in plot \ref{fig:Colima-Accel1}. It is the opposite in MC and PF. In plot \ref{fig:Colima-Accel1}c, in MC and PF there can a significant peak in acceleration, up to $\sim 15 m/s^2$ and $\sim 10 m/s^2$, in the 95$^{th}$ percentile values, respectively. The same peak is absent in the average plots, which are significantly flat in all the models, with values at $\sim 1 m/s^2$ in MC and PF, and $\sim 0.5 m/s^2$ in VS, at $\sim 200 s$. Plot \ref{fig:Colima-Accel1}e is similar, but PF is significantly reduced and lack of the peak in the 95$^{th}$ percentile values. In plot \ref{fig:Colima-Accel1}d,f, only MC shows significant acceleration values. Like in Fig.\ref{fig:Colima-Fr1}, plots \ref{fig:Colima-Accel1}g,h,i, are a zoom on the acceleration values in the distal locations, displayed on a long time window of $7200 s$. The last two plots are more noisy and possess an increasing trend. All the three show, in all the models, values up to $\sim 1 m/s^2$. In general, PF acceleration tends to be lower than in the other models.

\subsubsection{Flow area and spatially averaged measurements}
Figure \ref{fig:Colima-spatial} shows the spatial average of speed and Froude Number, for the three rheology models. Moreover, it shows the inundated area of flow, as a function of time.
\begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{BAF_VolcanDeColima/AveragedMeasurments/Averaged_MeasuresColima.png}
        \caption{Comparison between spatial averages of $(a)$ flow speed, and $(b)$ Froude Number in addition to the $(c)$ inundated area, as a function of time.}
        \label{fig:Colima-spatial}
\end{figure}
Like in Fig.\ref{fig:Ramp-spatial},spatial averages and inundated area have smoother plots than local measurements, and most of the details observed in local measurements are not easy to discern. In plot \ref{fig:Colima-spatial}a the speed shows a bell-shaped profile in all the models, but whereas the values where significantly similar in the inclined plane experiment, here the maximum speed is $\sim 60 m/s$ in MC, $\sim 50 m/s$ in PF, $\sim 20 m/s$ in VS, on average. Uncertainty is $\pm 18 m/s$ in MC, similar, but skewed on the larger values in VS, $\pm 10 m/s$ in PF. In plot \ref{fig:Colima-spatial}b, the Froude profile is very similar to the speed, but the difference between Vs and the other models is accentuated. Maximum values are $\sim 50$ in MC, $\sim 38$ in PF, $\sim 5$ in VS, whereas uncertainty is $\pm 10$ in MC, $\pm 7$ in PF, and skewed $[-5, +10]$ in VS. In plot \ref{fig:Colima-spatial}c, inundated area has a first peak in MC and PF, both at $\sim 1.15 km^2$, followed by a decrease to $0.55 km^2$ and $0.7 km^2$ ,respectively, and then a slower increase up to a flat plateau at $0.9 km^2$ and $1.5 km^2$, respectively. Uncertainty is $\sim \pm 0.2 km^2$ in both MC and PF until $\sim 100 s$, and then they increase at $\pm 0.3 km^2$ and $[-0.5, +0.4] km^2$, respectively. In MC the increase on uncertainty is particularly significant at $\sim 100 s$, while it is more gradual in PF. VS has a different profile. The initial peak is significant only in the 95$^{th}$ percentile values, and occurs significantly later, i.e. at $\sim 100 s$ against $\sim 50 s$ in MC and PF. It is of $\sim 1 km^2$ on the average, but up to $\sim 1.8 km^2$ in the 95$^{th}$ percentile. The decrease after the peak is very slow and the average inundated area is never below $0.85 km^2$, and eventually reaches back to $\sim 1 km^2$. Uncertainty is $[-0.3, +0.2] km^2$.

\subsection{Statistical analysis of dynamic quantities}\label{Hq2}
The current case study does not show a preferential direction, equivalent to the slope direction of the inclined plane. Hence, we will focus on the moduli, and powers, of the force terms detailed in Section \ref{Hq1}. In particular, all the estimates assume the material density of the flow $\rho = 1800 kg/m^3$. This a fixed scaling factor, and the plots aspect is not affected by its value.

\subsubsection{Forces, spatial integral}
Figure \ref{fig:Colima-F-spatial} shows the spatial sum of the force terms moduli, for the three rheology models. 
\begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{BAF_VolcanDeColima/AveragedMeasurments/ForcesColima.png}
        \caption{Spatial average of the RHS force terms moduli. Bold line is mean value, dashed lines are 5$^{\mathrm{th}}$ and 95$^{\mathrm{th}}$ percentile bounds.}
        \label{fig:Colima-F-spatial}
\end{figure}
The figure can be compared with Fig. \ref{fig:Ramp-Fx-spatial}, which was related to forces in the slope direction in the inclined plane case study. In plot \ref{fig:Colima-F-spatial}a $\boldsymbol{RHS_1}$ represents the effect of the gravity in all the models. It is decreasing in all the models, but more gradually in VS than in the others. Initial values are $2.8e9 N$ in all the models, uncertainty $\pm 2.5e8 N$. Force values are consistent with the material weight component along the mountain slope, and their decrease is related to the slope reduction. At $\sim 10 s$ all the models show a slowing down of the decrease, which is permanent in VS, and lasting $10 s$ in MC and PF. The latter models, reach a flat profile after $\sim 60 s$, at $6e8 N$ and $7e8 N$, respectively, and uncertainty of $\pm 2e8 N$ and $1.5e8 N$. VS, which flattens more gradually, is $1.3e9 N$ at $200 s$, uncertainty $[-7e8,+8e8] N$. In plot  \ref{fig:Colima-F-spatial}b $\boldsymbol{RHS_2}$ represents the effect of the basal friction in all the models. In MC, shows a bimodal profile, with a peak at $5 s$, and a second one at $60 s$. Both of them at $9.5e8 N$ on average, with uncertainty of $[-4e8,+5e8] N$ in the first peak, and $[-5e8,+7e8] N$ in the second. The minimum between the two peaks is at $8e8 N$ and lasts from $10 s$ to $30 s$. After the second peak there is significant decrease, reaching $6e8 N$ at $90 s$, and becoming flat. Final uncertainty is $[-4e8, +6e8] N$. In PF, the plot starts from lower initial values than in the other models, but then has a unimodal peak of $1.4e9 N$ at $40 s$, on average. Uncertainty $\pm 5e8 N$. After that, the plot decreases, reaching $7.5e8 N$ at $90 s$, and becoming flat. Final uncertainty is $\pm 3.5e8 N N$, lower than in the other models. In VS, there is slow increase until the plot reaches $1.05e9 N$ at $70 s$. Then the average force is almost flat, at $1.0e9 N$, with significant uncertainty of $[-5e8,+6e8] N$. In plot \ref{fig:Colima-F-spatial}c $\boldsymbol{RHS_3}$ represents the effect of the curvature of terrain. The three models all show a bell-shaped profile, waning to zero at $90 s$. However, MC has reaches $1.1e9 N$ at $30 s$, PF $8e8 N$ at $20 s$, VS $2.5e8 N$ at $10 s$. The rise has a similar profile, but a different duration. The decrease is more gradual in VS. Uncertainty at the peak value is $\pm 4.5e8 N$ in MC, $[-2.5e8,+3.5e8] N$ in PF, $\pm 2e8 N$ in VS. In plot \ref{fig:Colima-F-spatial}d $\boldsymbol{RHS_4}$ has a different meaning in the three models. In MC it is the internal friction term, and it has a small peak in the first second, at $1e8 N$. After that it flattens to negligible values, but shows again values at $5e7 N$ after $60 s$. In PF it is the a depth averaged correction in the hydrostatic pressure, and has a almost negligible effect only in the first second, at $5e7 N$. In VS, instead, it is the velocity dependent term, and has a very relevant effect. The plot shows a bell-shaped profile, with a peak of $1.45e9 N$ at $20 s$. Uncertainty is $[-5.5e8, +6.6e8] N$, at the peak. After that, the force gradually decreases, and is $3e8 N$ at $200 s$, on average. Uncertainty $[-3e8, +7e8] N$. In plot \ref{fig:Colima-F-spatial}d, the modulus of the total force $\sum^4_{i=1}\boldsymbol{RHS_i}$ is shown, with the complex interplay between the terms. First a steep decrease due to the domination of the gravity upon the friction, then a bell-shaped increase when the friction stops the dynamics.
\newpage
\subsubsection{Powers, spatial integral}
Figure \ref{fig:Colima-Power-spatial} shows the spatial sum of the powers, for the three rheology models. 
\begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{BAF_VolcanDeColima/AveragedMeasurments/PowersColima.png}
        \caption{Spatial average of the RHS powers. Bold line is mean value, dashed lines are 5$^{\mathrm{th}}$ and 95$^{\mathrm{th}}$ percentile bounds. Model comparison on the mean value is also displayed.}
        \label{fig:Colima-Power-spatial}
\end{figure}
The plots follow the same order used in Fig. \ref{fig:Colima-F-spatial}, but the scalar product with velocity imposes the bell-shaped profile already observed in Fig. \ref{fig:Ramp-Power-spatial}a. In plot \ref{fig:Colima-Power-spatial}a the power of $\boldsymbol{RHS_1}$ starts from zero and rises up to $\sim 1.4e11 W$ in MC, $\sim 1.2e11 W$ in PF, $\sim 6.5e10 W$ in VS. Uncertainty is $\pm 4e10 W$ in MC, $\pm 3e10 W$ in PF, $[-4e10,+5e10] W$ in VS. In plot \ref{fig:Colima-Power-spatial}b the power of  $\boldsymbol{RHS_2}$ is negative and peaks to $\sim -6.5e10 W$ in MC, $\sim -5e10 W$ in PF, $\sim -2e10 W$ in VS. Again VS power is significantly lower than in the other models. Uncertainty is $\pm 2e10 W$ in MC, $\pm 1.5e10 W$ in PF, $[-2e10,+1e10] W$ in VS. In plot \ref{fig:Colima-Power-spatial}c the power of $\boldsymbol{RHS_3}$ has a similar profile to the force, peaking to $\sim -7e10 W$ in MC, $\sim -4.5e10 W$ in PF, $\sim 5e9 W$ in VS. Uncertainty is $[-4.5e10,+3.5e10] W$ in MC, $[-2.5e10,+2e10] W$ in PF, $[-1e10,+5e9] W$ in VS. In plot \ref{fig:Colima-Power-spatial}d the power of $\boldsymbol{RHS_4}$ is relevant only in VS, although also in PF has a very short lasting positive peak up to $5e9 W$ before to become null at $\sim 10 s$. Peak negative power in VS is  $\sim -3.5e10 W$, $[-2e10,+1e10] W$. In plot \ref{fig:Colima-Power-spatial}e the power of the total force $\sum^4_{i=1}\boldsymbol{RHS_i}$ summarizes the energy accumulation and dissipation, following, like in the inclined plane case study, a sinusoid profile. As observed in Fig. \ref{fig:Ramp-Fx-spatial}e, MC profile is delayed compared to the others, and is affected by a larger uncertainty.

The Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) is a well established procedure for defining pseudo-random designs of samples in $\mathbb R^d$, with good properties with respect to the uniform probability distribution on an hypercube $[0,1]^d$ \citep{McKay1979,Owen1992b,Stein1987,Ranjan2014,Mingyao2016}. In particular, compared to a random sampling, a LHS: (i) enhances the capability to fill the d-dimensional space with a finite number of points, (ii) in case $d>1$, avoids the overlapping of point locations in the one dimensional projections, (iii) reduces the dependence of the number of points necessary on the dimensionality $d$.

\begin{definition}[Latin hypercube sampling]
Let $\Xi=\{\xi_i\ :\ i=1,\dots,N\}$ be a set of points inside the d-dimensional hypercube $C=[0,1]^d$. Let $[0,1]=\bigcup_{j=1}^{N} I_j$, where $I_j=[\frac{(j-1)}{N},\frac{j}{N}]$. Let $\xi_i=\left(\xi_i^1,\dots,\xi_i^d\right)$, and for each $k\in\{1,\dots,d\}$, let $\Xi^k=\{\xi^k_i\ :\ i=1,\dots,N\}$. Let $\lambda^d$ be the uniform probability measure supported inside $C$, called Lebesgue measure. Then $\Xi$ is a latin hypercube w.r.t. $\lambda^d$ $\Longleftrightarrow$ $\forall j\in \{1,\dots,N\}$, $\forall k\in\{1,\dots,d\}$, $\left|I_j\cap\Xi^k\right|=1$.
\end{definition}

The procedure is simple: once the desired number of samples $N\in\mathbb N$ is selected, and $[0,1]$ is divided in $N$ equal bins, then each bin will contain one and only one projection of the samples over every coordinate. The LHS definition is trivially generalized over $C=\prod^d_i [a_i, b_i]$, i.e. the cartesian product of $d$ arbitrary intervals. That will be applied in this study, defining LHS over the parameter domain of the flow models.

There are a large number of possible designs, corresponding the number of permutations of the bins in the d-projections, i.e. $d\cdot N!$. If the permutations are randomly sampled there is a high possibility that the design will have good properties. However, this is not assured, and clusters o points or regions of void space may be observed in $C$. For this reason, we base our design on the orthogonal arrays (OA) \citep{Owen1992a,Tang1993}.

\begin{definition}[Orthogonal arrays]
Let $S=\{1,\dots,s\}$, where $s\ge 2$. Let $Q\in S^{n\times m}$ be a matrix of such integer values. Then $Q$ is called an $OA(n,m,s,r)$ $\Longleftrightarrow$ each $n\times r$ submatrix of $Q$ contains all possible $1\times r$ row vectors with the same frequency $\lambda=n/s^r$, which is called the index of the array. In particular, $r$ is called the strength, $n$ the size, $(m\ge r)$ the constrains, and $s$ the levels of the array.
\end{definition}

Orthogonal arrays are very useful for defining latin hypercubes which are also forced to fill the space (or its r-dimensional subspaces) in a more robust way, at the cost of potentially requiring a larger number of points than a traditional LHS.

\begin{proposition}
Let $Q$ be an $OA(n,m,s,r)$. Then let $U\in\mathbb R^{n\times m}$ be defined as follows:
$$\forall k\in \{1,\dots,s\},\ \forall j\in \{1,\dots,m\},\ \left\{Q[\cdot,j]\ :\ Q[i,j]=k\right\} = \Pi\left(\{(k-1)\lambda s^{r-1},\dots, k\lambda s^{r-1}\}\right),$$
where $\Pi$ is a random permutation of $\lambda s^{r-1}$ elements. Then $\Xi=\{\xi_i=U[i,\cdot]\ :\ i=1,\dots,n\}$ is a LHS w.r.t to $\lambda^m$ over $C=[0,1]^m$. Moreover, let $[0,1]^r=\bigcup_{(h_1,\dots,h_r)=1}^{s} I_{(h_i)}$, where $I_{(h_i)}=\prod^r_i[\frac{(h_i-1)}{s},\frac{h_i}{s}]$. Then $\forall D=(d_1,\dots,d_r)\subseteq \{1,\dots,m\}$, let $\Xi^D=\{(\xi^{d_1},\dots,\xi^{d_r})\ :\ i=1,\dots,n\}$. We have that
$$\forall k\in \{1,\dots,s\},\ \forall (h_i\ : i=1,\dots,r)\in\{1,\dots,d\}^r,\ \left|I_{(k_i)}\cap\Xi^D\right|=\lambda.$$
\end{proposition}

For each column of $Q$ we are replacing the $\lambda s^{r-1}$ elements with entry $k$ by a random permutation of $\left((k-1)\lambda s^{r-1} + h\right)_{h\in 1,\dots, \lambda s^{r-1}}$. After the replacement procedure is done, the newly obtained matrix $U$ is equivalent to a LHS which inherits from $Q$ the property of fully covering $s^r$ equal r-dimensional hypercubes in every r-dimensional projection. Each hypercube contains $\lambda$ points. In other words, inside each r-dimensional projection, the design associated to $U$ fills the space like a regular grid at the scale of those $s^r$ hypercubes, but it is still an LHS at a finer scale, i.e. the $\lambda s^{r-1}$ one dimensional bins. A complete proof can be found in \cite{Tang1993} and it is a straightforward verification of the required properties.

However, even in an LHS based on an $OA(n,m,s,r)$, if $r<m$ what happens in the projections with dimension $r'>r$ is not controlled, and randomizing procedures are made more difficult by the additional structure imposed by the $OA$. Moreover, the total number of points necessary to achieve a full design increases with $r$, and hence is affected by dimensionality issues.

Dealing with relatively small $d$, i.e. $d\in\{3,4\}$, we adopt a LHS $U$ created by a $OA(s^d,d,s,d)$. The strength is equal to the dimension $d$, hence the design fills the entire space like a $d$ dimensional grid, but it is a LHS as well. In this case there is one point in each hypercube, and $\lambda=1$. We take $s=8$ for the 3-dimensional designs over the parameter space of Mohr-Coulomb and Voellmy-Salm models, i.e. $512$ points; we took $s=6$ for the 4-dimensional designs over the more complex parameter space of the Pouliquen-Forterre model, i.e. 1296 points.
