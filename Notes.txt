-NOTES-
PLAN

----------------
1)parameter spaces
ok-CHANGE PARAMETER RANGES phi_bed should be smaller, second parameter should be phi_int-phi_bed, in [3-10] deg.
Do a consistent change also for the Voellmy and Pouliquen.

ok-CALCULATE FROUDE NUMBER 

??-NORMALIZATION STRATEGY oF PARAMETER SPACES? MAYBE BASED ON THE NORM OF DEVIATORIC STRESS?

??-make the variance based analysis in an appendix to justify parameter space reduction of Pouliquen



---------------
2)additional outputs of interest
??-MAKE PLOT of 'EVER INVADED AREA' THROUGH TIME - WE CAN SIMPLY GET THE AREA OF MAXPILEHEIGHT MATRIX WHICH IS ABOVE THE FLOW_TINY 

ok-INCLUDE left-hand side FORCES PLOTS - inertial and convective

ok-PLOT TOGHETER SAME FORCE BUT DIFFERENT MODELS.



---------------
3)additional analysis
??-MAKE ANOTHER CONTRIBUTION COEFFICIENT, WITH PHI:= \sum_i |F_i|/2, including fictious forces.


??-MAKE ANOVA IN ADDITION TO EXPECTATION (i.e. MAX CONTRIBUTION TO VARIANCE OF THE TOTAL FORCE)



---------------
4) new idea
??-PLOT DIFFERENCE OF FLOWS COMPARING DIFFERENT MODELS? POSSIBLY plot at time t THE MAX of DIFFERENCE OVER TIME [0,t].



---------------
5) changes in the draft
??-INCLUDE PLOT OF THE REAL EXPERIMENT, and manually shift time axis to better fit the simulation. 
Say that we are not making further analysis because measures are difficult and we are not making calibration, but parameter spaces exploration here.

??-put caption above the figures

??-correct everywhere: local 'forces' are indeed local 'stresses'. We should use the term 'force' if we divide by m2. 10^4 N/m2 is not a force.
Another strategy is to divide by the element area and plot the Newtons obtained.

ok-make section 1.2 less volcanological

ok-split section 1.3 in two - kinematic + rheology assumptions

ok-put global average plots before local plots
